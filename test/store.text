                 alices adventures in wonderland 
  
                           lewis carroll 
  
                the millennium fulcrum edition . 
  
  
  
  
                             chapter i 
  
                       down the rabbithole 
  
  
   alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister 
 on the bank, and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had 
 peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no 
 pictures or conversations in it, and what is the use of a book, 
 thought alice without pictures or conversation 
  
   so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, 
 for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether 
 the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble 
 of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a white 
 rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. 
  
   there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice 
 think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to 
 itself, oh dear  oh dear  i shall be late  (when she thought 
 it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have 
 wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural) 
 but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat 
 pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started to 
 her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never 
 before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket, or a watch to 
 take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the 
 field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop 
 down a large rabbithole under the hedge. 
  
   in another moment down went alice after it, never once 
 considering how in the world she was to get out again. 
  
   the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, 
 and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not a 
 moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself 
 falling down a very deep well. 
  
   either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she 
 had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to 
 wonder what was going to happen next.  first, she tried to look 
 down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to 
 see anything then she looked at the sides of the well, and 
 noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves 
 here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  she 
 took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was 
 labelled orange marmalade, but to her great disappointment it 
 was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing 
 somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she 
 fell past it. 
  
   well thought alice to herself, after such a fall as this, i 
 shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs  how brave theyll 
 all think me at home  why, i wouldnt say anything about it, 
 even if i fell off the top of the house (which was very likely 
 true.) 
  
   down, down, down.  would the fall never come to an end  i 
 wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud. 
 i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  let 
 me see  that would be four thousand miles down, i think (for, 
 you see, alice had learnt several things of this sort in her 
 lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good 
 opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to 
 listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) yes, 
 thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude 
 or longitude ive got to  (alice had no idea what latitude was, 
 or longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to 
 say.) 
  
   presently she began again.  i wonder if i shall fall right 
 through the earth  how funny itll seem to come out among the 
 people that walk with their heads downward  the antipathies, i 
 think (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this 
 time, as it didnt sound at all the right word) but i shall 
 have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. 
 please, maam, is this new zealand or australia (and she tried 
 to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling 
 through the air  do you think you could manage it)  and what 
 an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking  no, itll 
 never do to ask  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere. 
  
   down, down, down.  there was nothing else to do, so alice soon 
 began talking again.  dinahll miss me very much tonight, i 
 should think  (dinah was the cat.)  i hope theyll remember 
 her saucer of milk at teatime.  dinah my dear  i wish you were 
 down here with me  there are no mice in the air, im afraid, but 
 you might catch a bat, and thats very like a mouse, you know. 
 but do cats eat bats, i wonder  and here alice began to get 
 rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of 
 way, do cats eat bats  do cats eat bats and sometimes, do 
 bats eat cats for, you see, as she couldnt answer either 
 question, it didnt much matter which way she put it.  she felt 
 that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she 
 was walking hand in hand with dinah, and saying to her very 
 earnestly, now, dinah, tell me the truth  did you ever eat a 
 bat when suddenly, thump thump down she came upon a heap of 
 sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. 
  
   alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a 
 moment  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead before her 
 was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still in 
 sight, hurrying down it.  there was not a moment to be lost 
 away went alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it 
 say, as it turned a corner, oh my ears and whiskers, how late 
 its getting  she was close behind it when she turned the 
 corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found 
 herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps 
 hanging from the roof. 
  
   there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked 
 and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the 
 other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, 
 wondering how she was ever to get out again. 
  
   suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table, all made of 
 solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, 
 and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the 
 doors of the hall but, alas either the locks were too large, or 
 the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of 
 them.  however, on the second time round, she came upon a low 
 curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little 
 door about fifteen inches high  she tried the little golden key 
 in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted 
  
   alice opened the door and found that it led into a small 
 passage, not much larger than a rathole  she knelt down and 
 looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. 
 how she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about 
 among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but 
 she could not even get her head though the doorway and even if 
 my head would go through, thought poor alice, it would be of 
 very little use without my shoulders.  oh, how i wish 
 i could shut up like a telescope  i think i could, if i only 
 know how to begin.  for, you see, so many outoftheway things 
 had happened lately, that alice had begun to think that very few 
 things indeed were really impossible. 
  
   there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she 
 went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on 
 it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like 
 telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it, (which 
 certainly was not here before, said alice,) and round the neck 
 of the bottle was a paper label, with the words drink me 
 beautifully printed on it in large letters. 
  
   it was all very well to say drink me, but the wise little 
 alice was not going to do that in a hurry.  no, ill look 
 first, she said, and see whether its marked poison or not 
 for she had read several nice little histories about children who 
 had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant 
 things, all because they would not remember the simple rules 
 their friends had taught them  such as, that a redhot poker 
 will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your 
 finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds and she had 
 never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked 
 poison, it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or 
 later. 
  
   however, this bottle was not marked poison, so alice ventured 
 to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort 
 of mixed flavour of cherrytart, custard, pineapple, roast 
 turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished 
 it off. 
  
                                                 
  
                                              
  
                                                 
  
   what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up 
 like a telescope. 
  
   and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high, and 
 her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right 
 size for going though the little door into that lovely garden. 
 first, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was 
 going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about 
 this for it might end, you know, said alice to herself, in my 
 going out altogether, like a candle.  i wonder what i should be 
 like then  and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is 
 like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember 
 ever having seen such a thing. 
  
   after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided 
 on going into the garden at once but, alas for poor alice when 
 she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden 
 key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she 
 could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly 
 through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the 
 legs of the table, but it was too slippery and when she had 
 tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and 
 cried. 
  
   come, theres no use in crying like that said alice to 
 herself, rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute 
 she generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very 
 seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so 
 severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered 
 trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game 
 of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious 
 child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  but its no 
 use now, thought poor alice, to pretend to be two people  why, 
 theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable 
 person 
  
   soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under 
 the table  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on 
 which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants. 
 well, ill eat it, said alice, and if it makes me grow larger, 
 i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller, i can creep 
 under the door so either way ill get into the garden, and i 
 dont care which happens 
  
   she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, which 
 way  which way, holding her hand on the top of her head to 
 feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to 
 find that she remained the same size  to be sure, this generally 
 happens when one eats cake, but alice had got so much into the 
 way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen, 
 that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the 
 common way. 
  
   so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. 
  
                                                 
  
                                              
  
                                                 
  
  
  
  
                            chapter ii 
  
                         the pool of tears 
  
  
   curiouser and curiouser cried alice (she was so much 
 surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good 
 english) now im opening out like the largest telescope that 
 ever was  goodbye, feet (for when she looked down at her 
 feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so 
 far off).  oh, my poor little feet, i wonder who will put on 
 your shoes and stockings for you now, dears  im sure i shant 
 be able  i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself 
 about you  you must manage the best way you can but i must be 
 kind to them, thought alice, or perhaps they wont walk the 
 way i want to go  let me see  ill give them a new pair of 
 boots every christmas. 
  
   and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. 
 they must go by the carrier, she thought and how funny itll 
 seem, sending presents to ones own feet  and how odd the 
 directions will look 
  
             alices right foot, esq. 
                 hearthrug, 
                     near the fender, 
                         (with alices love). 
  
 oh dear, what nonsense im talking 
  
   just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in 
 fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took 
 up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door. 
  
   poor alice  it was as much as she could do, lying down on one 
 side, to look through into the garden with one eye but to get 
 through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to 
 cry again. 
  
   you ought to be ashamed of yourself, said alice, a great 
 girl like you, (she might well say this), to go on crying in 
 this way  stop this moment, i tell you  but she went on all 
 the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool 
 all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the 
 hall. 
  
   after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the 
 distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. 
 it was the white rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a 
 pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the 
 other  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to 
 himself as he came, oh the duchess, the duchess oh wont she 
 be savage if ive kept her waiting  alice felt so desperate 
 that she was ready to ask help of any one so, when the rabbit 
 came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, if you please, 
 sir  the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid 
 gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard 
 as he could go. 
  
   alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very 
 hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking 
 dear, dear  how queer everything is today  and yesterday 
 things went on just as usual.  i wonder if ive been changed in 
 the night  let me think  was i the same when i got up this 
 morning  i almost think i can remember feeling a little 
 different.  but if im not the same, the next question is, who in 
 the world am i  ah, thats the great puzzle  and she began 
 thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age 
 as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of 
 them. 
  
   im sure im not ada, she said, for her hair goes in such 
 long ringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im 
 sure i cant be mabel, for i know all sorts of things, and she, 
 oh she knows such a very little  besides, shes she, and im i, 
 andoh dear, how puzzling it all is  ill try if i know all the 
 things i used to know.  let me see  four times five is twelve, 
 and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven isoh dear 
 i shall never get to twenty at that rate  however, the 
 multiplication table doesnt signify  lets try geography. 
 london is the capital of paris, and paris is the capital of rome, 
 and romeno, thats all wrong, im certain  i must have been 
 changed for mabel  ill try and say how doth the little 
 and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, 
 and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and 
 strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do 
  
             how doth the little crocodile 
               improve his shining tail, 
             and pour the waters of the nile 
               on every golden scale 
  
             how cheerfully he seems to grin, 
               how neatly spread his claws, 
             and welcome little fishes in 
               with gently smiling jaws 
  
   im sure those are not the right words, said poor alice, and 
 her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, i must be mabel 
 after all, and i shall have to go and live in that poky little 
 house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh ever so 
 many lessons to learn  no, ive made up my mind about it if im 
 mabel, ill stay down here  itll be no use their putting their 
 heads down and saying come up again, dear  i shall only look 
 up and say who am i then  tell me that first, and then, if i 
 like being that person, ill come up  if not, ill stay down 
 here till im somebody elsebut, oh dear cried alice, with a 
 sudden burst of tears, i do wish they would put their heads 
 down  i am so very tired of being all alone here 
  
   as she said this she looked down at her hands, and was 
 surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little 
 white kid gloves while she was talking.  how can i have done 
 that she thought.  i must be growing small again.  she got up 
 and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, 
 as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, 
 and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the 
 cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it 
 hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. 
  
 that was a narrow escape said alice, a good deal frightened at 
 the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in 
 existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed 
 back to the little door  but, alas the little door was shut 
 again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as 
 before, and things are worse than ever, thought the poor child, 
 for i never was so small as this before, never  and i declare 
 its too bad, that it is 
  
   as she said these words her foot slipped, and in another 
 moment, splash she was up to her chin in salt water.  he first 
 idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that 
 case i can go back by railway, she said to herself.  (alice had 
 been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general 
 conclusion, that wherever you go to on the english coast you find 
 a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in 
 the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and 
 behind them a railway station.)  however, she soon made out that 
 she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine 
 feet high. 
  
   i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice, as she swam about, 
 trying to find her way out.  i shall be punished for it now, i 
 suppose, by being drowned in my own tears  that will be a queer 
 thing, to be sure  however, everything is queer today. 
  
   just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a 
 little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at 
 first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then 
 she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that 
 it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. 
  
   would it be of any use, now, thought alice, to speak to this 
 mouse  everything is so outoftheway down here, that i should 
 think very likely it can talk  at any rate, theres no harm in 
 trying.  so she began  o mouse, do you know the way out of 
 this pool  i am very tired of swimming about here, o mouse 
 (alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse 
 she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having 
 seen in her brothers latin grammar, a mouseof a mouseto a 
 mousea mouseo mouse  the mouse looked at her rather 
 inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little 
 eyes, but it said nothing. 
  
   perhaps it doesnt understand english, thought alice i 
 daresay its a french mouse, come over with william the 
 conqueror.  (for, with all her knowledge of history, alice had 
 no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  so she 
 began again  ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in 
 her french lessonbook.  the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the 
 water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  oh, i beg 
 your pardon cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the 
 poor animals feelings.  i quite forgot you didnt like cats. 
  
   not like cats cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate 
 voice.  would you like cats if you were me 
  
   well, perhaps not, said alice in a soothing tone  dont be 
 angry about it.  and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah 
 i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. 
 she is such a dear quiet thing, alice went on, half to herself, 
 as she swam lazily about in the pool, and she sits purring so 
 nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her faceand 
 she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital 
 one for catching miceoh, i beg your pardon cried alice again, 
 for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt 
 certain it must be really offended.  we wont talk about her any 
 more if youd rather not. 
  
   we indeed cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end 
 of his tail.  as if i would talk on such a subject  our family 
 always hated cats  nasty, low, vulgar things  dont let me hear 
 the name again 
  
   i wont indeed said alice, in a great hurry to change the 
 subject of conversation.  are youare you fondofof dogs 
 the mouse did not answer, so alice went on eagerly  there is 
 such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you 
 a little brighteyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly 
 brown hair  and itll fetch things when you throw them, and 
 itll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of thingsi 
 cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer, you 
 know, and he says its so useful, its worth a hundred pounds 
 he says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried alice in a 
 sorrowful tone, im afraid ive offended it again  for the 
 mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and 
 making quite a commotion in the pool as it went. 
  
   so she called softly after it, mouse dear  do come back 
 again, and we wont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont 
 like them  when the mouse heard this, it turned round and swam 
 slowly back to her  its face was quite pale (with passion, alice 
 thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, let us get to 
 the shore, and then ill tell you my history, and youll 
 understand why it is i hate cats and dogs. 
  
   it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded 
 with the birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a 
 duck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curious 
 creatures.  alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the 
 shore. 
  
  
  
                            chapter iii 
  
                   a caucusrace and a long tale 
  
  
   they were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the 
 bankthe birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their 
 fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and 
 uncomfortable. 
  
   the first question of course was, how to get dry again  they 
 had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed 
 quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with 
 them, as if she had known them all her life.  indeed, she had 
 quite a long argument with the lory, who at last turned sulky, 
 and would only say, i am older than you, and must know better 
 and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, 
 and, as the lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no 
 more to be said. 
  
   at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among 
 them, called out, sit down, all of you, and listen to me  ill 
 soon make you dry enough  they all sat down at once, in a large 
 ring, with the mouse in the middle.  alice kept her eyes 
 anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad 
 cold if she did not get dry very soon. 
  
   ahem said the mouse with an important air, are you all ready 
 this is the driest thing i know.  silence all round, if you please 
 william the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was 
 soon submitted to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had been 
 of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  edwin and 
 morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria 
  
   ugh said the lory, with a shiver. 
  
   i beg your pardon said the mouse, frowning, but very 
 politely  did you speak 
  
   not i said the lory hastily. 
  
   i thought you did, said the mouse.  i proceed.  edwin and 
 morcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria, declared for him 
 and even stigand, the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found 
 it advisable 
  
   found what said the duck. 
  
   found it, the mouse replied rather crossly  of course you 
 know what it means. 
  
   i know what it means well enough, when i find a thing, said 
 the duck  its generally a frog or a worm.  the question is, 
 what did the archbishop find 
  
   the mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, 
 found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william 
 and offer him the crown.  williams conduct at first was 
 moderate.  but the insolence of his normans  how are you 
 getting on now, my dear it continued, turning to alice as it 
 spoke. 
  
   as wet as ever, said alice in a melancholy tone  it doesnt 
 seem to dry me at all. 
  
   in that case, said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, i 
 move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more 
 energetic remedies 
  
   speak english said the eaglet.  i dont know the meaning of 
 half those long words, and, whats more, i dont believe you do 
 either  and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile 
 some of the other birds tittered audibly. 
  
   what i was going to say, said the dodo in an offended tone, 
 was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusrace. 
  
   what is a caucusrace said alice not that she wanted much 
 to know, but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody 
 ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. 
  
   why, said the dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it. 
 (and, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter 
 day, i will tell you how the dodo managed it.) 
  
   first it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, (the 
 exact shape doesnt matter, it said,) and then all the party 
 were placed along the course, here and there.  there was no one, 
 two, three, and away, but they began running when they liked, 
 and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know 
 when the race was over.  however, when they had been running half 
 an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the dodo suddenly called 
 out the race is over and they all crowded round it, panting, 
 and asking, but who has won 
  
   this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of 
 thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon 
 its forehead (the position in which you usually see shakespeare, 
 in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  at 
 last the dodo said, everybody has won, and all must have 
 prizes. 
  
   but who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices 
 asked. 
  
   why, she, of course, said the dodo, pointing to alice with 
 one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her, 
 calling out in a confused way, prizes prizes 
  
   alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand 
 in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt 
 water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. 
 there was exactly one apiece all round. 
  
   but she must have a prize herself, you know, said the mouse. 
  
   of course, the dodo replied very gravely.  what else have 
 you got in your pocket he went on, turning to alice. 
  
   only a thimble, said alice sadly. 
  
   hand it over here, said the dodo. 
  
   then they all crowded round her once more, while the dodo 
 solemnly presented the thimble, saying we beg your acceptance of 
 this elegant thimble and, when it had finished this short 
 speech, they all cheered. 
  
   alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked 
 so grave that she did not dare to laugh and, as she could not 
 think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, 
 looking as solemn as she could. 
  
   the next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise 
 and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not 
 taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on 
 the back.  however, it was over at last, and they sat down again 
 in a ring, and begged the mouse to tell them something more. 
  
   you promised to tell me your history, you know, said alice, 
 and why it is you hatec and d, she added in a whisper, half 
 afraid that it would be offended again. 
  
   mine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse, turning to 
 alice, and sighing. 
  
   it is a long tail, certainly, said alice, looking down with 
 wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad  and 
 she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking, so 
 that her idea of the tale was something like this 
  
                     fury said to a 
                    mouse, that he 
                  met in the 
                house, 
             let us 
               both go to 
                 law  i will 
                   prosecute 
                     you.  come, 
                        ill take no 
                         denial we 
                      must have a 
                  trial  for 
               really this 
            morning ive 
           nothing 
          to do. 
            said the 
              mouse to the 
                cur, such 
                  a trial, 
                    dear sir, 
                          with 
                      no jury 
                   or judge, 
                 would be 
               wasting 
              our 
               breath. 
                ill be 
                  judge, ill 
                    be jury, 
                          said 
                     cunning 
                       old fury 
                      ill 
                       try the 
                          whole 
                           cause, 
                              and 
                         condemn 
                        you 
                       to 
                        death. 
  
  
   you are not attending said the mouse to alice severely. 
 what are you thinking of 
  
   i beg your pardon, said alice very humbly  you had got to 
 the fifth bend, i think 
  
   i had not cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily. 
  
   a knot said alice, always ready to make herself useful, and 
 looking anxiously about her.  oh, do let me help to undo it 
  
   i shall do nothing of the sort, said the mouse, getting up 
 and walking away.  you insult me by talking such nonsense 
  
   i didnt mean it pleaded poor alice.  but youre so easily 
 offended, you know 
  
   the mouse only growled in reply. 
  
   please come back and finish your story alice called after 
 it and the others all joined in chorus, yes, please do but 
 the mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little 
 quicker. 
  
   what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory, as soon as it 
 was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of 
 saying to her daughter ah, my dear  let this be a lesson to you 
 never to lose your temper  hold your tongue, ma said the 
 young crab, a little snappishly.  youre enough to try the 
 patience of an oyster 
  
   i wish i had our dinah here, i know i do said alice aloud, 
 addressing nobody in particular.  shed soon fetch it back 
  
   and who is dinah, if i might venture to ask the question 
 said the lory. 
  
   alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about 
 her pet  dinahs our cat.  and shes such a capital one for 
 catching mice you cant think  and oh, i wish you could see her 
 after the birds  why, shell eat a little bird as soon as look 
 at it 
  
   this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. 
 some of the birds hurried off at once  one the old magpie began 
 wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, i really must be 
 getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a canary 
 called out in a trembling voice to its children, come away, my 
 dears  its high time you were all in bed  on various pretexts 
 they all moved off, and alice was soon left alone. 
  
   i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a 
 melancholy tone.  nobody seems to like her, down here, and im 
 sure shes the best cat in the world  oh, my dear dinah  i 
 wonder if i shall ever see you any more  and here poor alice 
 began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and lowspirited. 
 in a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of 
 footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping 
 that the mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to 
 finish his story. 
  
  
  
                            chapter iv 
  
                 the rabbit sends in a little bill 
  
  
   it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and 
 looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something 
 and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess  the duchess 
 oh my dear paws  oh my fur and whiskers  shell get me 
 executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets  where can i have 
 dropped them, i wonder  alice guessed in a moment that it was 
 looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she 
 very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them, but they were 
 nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her 
 swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and 
 the little door, had vanished completely. 
  
   very soon the rabbit noticed alice, as she went hunting about, 
 and called out to her in an angry tone, why, mary ann, what are 
 you doing out here  run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of 
 gloves and a fan  quick, now  and alice was so much frightened 
 that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without 
 trying to explain the mistake it had made. 
  
   he took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran. 
 how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am  but id 
 better take him his fan and glovesthat is, if i can find them. 
 as she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door 
 of which was a bright brass plate with the name w. rabbit 
 engraved upon it.  she went in without knocking, and hurried 
 upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann, 
 and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and 
 gloves. 
  
   how queer it seems, alice said to herself, to be going 
 messages for a rabbit  i suppose dinahll be sending me on 
 messages next  and she began fancying the sort of thing that 
 would happen  miss alice  come here directly, and get ready 
 for your walk coming in a minute, nurse  but ive got to see 
 that the mouse doesnt get out.  only i dont think, alice went 
 on, that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering 
 people about like that 
  
   by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with 
 a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two 
 or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and 
 a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when 
 her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking 
 glass.  there was no label this time with the words drink me, 
 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  i know 
 something interesting is sure to happen, she said to herself, 
 whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this 
 bottle does.  i do hope itll make me grow large again, for 
 really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing 
  
   it did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected 
 before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing 
 against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being 
 broken.  she hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself 
 thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is, i 
 cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so 
 much 
  
   alas it was too late to wish that  she went on growing, and 
 growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in 
 another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried 
 the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the 
 other arm curled round her head.  still she went on growing, and, 
 as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one 
 foot up the chimney, and said to herself now i can do no more, 
 whatever happens.  what will become of me 
  
   luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full 
 effect, and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable, 
 and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting 
 out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. 
  
   it was much pleasanter at home, thought poor alice, when one 
 wasnt always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about 
 by mice and rabbits.  i almost wish i hadnt gone down that 
 rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious, you know, 
 this sort of life  i do wonder what can have happened to me 
 when i used to read fairytales, i fancied that kind of thing 
 never happened, and now here i am in the middle of one  there 
 ought to be a book written about me, that there ought  and when 
 i grow up, ill write onebut im grown up now, she added in a 
 sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more 
 here. 
  
   but then, thought alice, shall i never get any older than i 
 am now  thatll be a comfort, one waynever to be an old woman 
 but thenalways to have lessons to learn  oh, i shouldnt like 
 that 
  
   oh, you foolish alice she answered herself.  how can you 
 learn lessons in here  why, theres hardly room for you, and no 
 room at all for any lessonbooks 
  
   and so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, 
 and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few 
 minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. 
  
   mary ann  mary ann said the voice.  fetch me my gloves 
 this moment  then came a little pattering of feet on the 
 stairs.  alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her, and 
 she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she 
 was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit, and had no 
 reason to be afraid of it. 
  
   presently the rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it 
 but, as the door opened inwards, and alices elbow was pressed 
 hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  alice heard it 
 say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window. 
  
   that you wont thought alice, and, after waiting till she 
 fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window, she suddenly 
 spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  she did not 
 get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, 
 and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was 
 just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe, or something 
 of the sort. 
  
   next came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat  where are 
 you  and then a voice she had never heard before, sure then 
 im here  digging for apples, yer honour 
  
   digging for apples, indeed said the rabbit angrily.  here 
 come and help me out of this  (sounds of more broken glass.) 
  
   now tell me, pat, whats that in the window 
  
   sure, its an arm, yer honour  (he pronounced it arrum.) 
  
   an arm, you goose   who ever saw one that size  why, it 
 fills the whole window 
  
   sure, it does, yer honour  but its an arm for all that. 
  
   well, its got no business there, at any rate  go and take it 
 away 
  
   there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hear 
 whispers now and then such as, sure, i dont like it, yer 
 honour, at all, at all  do as i tell you, you coward and at 
 last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in 
 the air.  this time there were two little shrieks, and more 
 sounds of broken glass.  what a number of cucumberframes there 
 must be thought alice.  i wonder what theyll do next  as for 
 pulling me out of the window, i only wish they could  im sure i 
 dont want to stay in here any longer 
  
   she waited for some time without hearing anything more  at 
 last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a 
 good many voice all talking together  she made out the words 
 wheres the other ladderwhy, i hadnt to bring but one 
 bills got the otherbill fetch it here, ladhere, put em up 
 at this cornerno, tie em together firstthey dont reach half 
 high enough yetoh theyll do well enough dont be particular 
 here, bill catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmind 
 that loose slateoh, its coming down  heads below (a loud 
 crash)now, who did thatit was bill, i fancywhos to go 
 down the chimneynay, i shant you do itthat i wont, 
 thenbills to go downhere, bill the master says youre to 
 go down the chimney 
  
   oh so bills got to come down the chimney, has he said 
 alice to herself.  shy, they seem to put everything upon bill 
 i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is 
 narrow, to be sure but i think i can kick a little 
  
   she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and 
 waited till she heard a little animal (she couldnt guess of what 
 sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close 
 above her  then, saying to herself this is bill, she gave one 
 sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. 
  
   the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes 
 bill then the rabbits voice alongcatch him, you by the 
 hedge then silence, and then another confusion of voiceshold 
 up his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it, old fellow 
 what happened to you  tell us all about it 
  
   last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (thats bill, 
 thought alice,) well, i hardly knowno more, thank ye im 
 better nowbut im a deal too flustered to tell youall i know 
 is, something comes at me like a jackinthebox, and up i goes 
 like a skyrocket 
  
   so you did, old fellow said the others. 
  
   we must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and 
 alice called out as loud as she could, if you do.  ill set 
 dinah at you 
  
   there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to 
 herself, i wonder what they will do next  if they had any 
 sense, theyd take the roof off.  after a minute or two, they 
 began moving about again, and alice heard the rabbit say, a 
 barrowful will do, to begin with. 
  
   a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to 
 doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came 
 rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. 
 ill put a stop to this, she said to herself, and shouted out, 
 youd better not do that again which produced another dead 
 silence. 
  
   alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all 
 turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright 
 idea came into her head.  if i eat one of these cakes, she 
 thought, its sure to make some change in my size and as it 
 cant possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, i 
 suppose. 
  
   so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find 
 that she began shrinking directly.  as soon as she was small 
 enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and 
 found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. 
 the poor little lizard, bill, was in the middle, being held up by 
 two guineapigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. 
 they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she 
 ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a 
 thick wood. 
  
   the first thing ive got to do, said alice to herself, as she 
 wandered about in the wood, is to grow to my right size again 
 and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. 
 i think that will be the best plan. 
  
   it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and 
 simply arranged the only difficulty was, that she had not the 
 smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering 
 about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over 
 her head made her look up in a great hurry. 
  
   an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round 
 eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. 
 poor little thing said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried 
 hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the 
 time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it 
 would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. 
  
   hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of 
 stick, and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped 
 into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, 
 and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it then alice 
 dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run 
 over and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy 
 made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in 
 its hurry to get hold of it then alice, thinking it was very 
 like having a game of play with a carthorse, and expecting every 
 moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle 
 again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the 
 stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long 
 way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat 
 down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its 
 mouth, and its great eyes half shut. 
  
   this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape 
 so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out 
 of breath, and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the 
 distance. 
  
   and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice, as she 
 leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself 
 with one of the leaves  i should have liked teaching it tricks 
 very much, ifif id only been the right size to do it  oh 
 dear  id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again  let 
 me seehow is it to be managed  i suppose i ought to eat or 
 drink something or other but the great question is, what 
  
   the great question certainly was, what  alice looked all round 
 her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see 
 anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under 
 the circumstances.  there was a large mushroom growing near her, 
 about the same height as herself and when she had looked under 
 it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her 
 that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it. 
  
   she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of 
 the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large 
 caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, 
 quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice 
 of her or of anything else. 
  
  
  
                             chapter v 
  
                     advice from a caterpillar 
  
  
   the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in 
 silence  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its 
 mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice. 
  
   who are you said the caterpillar. 
  
   this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  alice 
 replied, rather shyly, ii hardly know, sir, just at present 
 at least i know who i was when i got up this morning, but i think 
 i must have been changed several times since then. 
  
   what do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly. 
 explain yourself 
  
   i cant explain myself, im afraid, sir said alice, because 
 im not myself, you see. 
  
   i dont see, said the caterpillar. 
  
   im afraid i cant put it more clearly, alice replied very 
 politely, for i cant understand it myself to begin with and 
 being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing. 
  
   it isnt, said the caterpillar. 
  
   well, perhaps you havent found it so yet, said alice but 
 when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day, you 
 knowand then after that into a butterfly, i should think youll 
 feel it a little queer, wont you 
  
   not a bit, said the caterpillar. 
  
   well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said alice 
 all i know is, it would feel very queer to me. 
  
   you said the caterpillar contemptuously.  who are you 
  
   which brought them back again to the beginning of the 
 conversation.  alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars 
 making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, 
 very gravely, i think, you ought to tell me who you are, first. 
  
   why said the caterpillar. 
  
   here was another puzzling question and as alice could not 
 think of any good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be in 
 a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away. 
  
   come back the caterpillar called after her.  ive something 
 important to say 
  
   this sounded promising, certainly  alice turned and came back 
 again. 
  
   keep your temper, said the caterpillar. 
  
   is that all said alice, swallowing down her anger as well as 
 she could. 
  
   no, said the caterpillar. 
  
   alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else 
 to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth 
 hearing.  for some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but 
 at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth 
 again, and said, so you think youre changed, do you 
  
   im afraid i am, sir, said alice i cant remember things as 
 i usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes together 
  
   cant remember what things said the caterpillar. 
  
   well, ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee, but it 
 all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voice. 
  
   repeat, you are old, father william, said the caterpillar. 
  
   alice folded her hands, and began 
  
     you are old, father william, the young man said, 
       and your hair has become very white 
     and yet you incessantly stand on your head 
       do you think, at your age, it is right 
  
     in my youth, father william replied to his son, 
       i feared it might injure the brain 
     but, now that im perfectly sure i have none, 
       why, i do it again and again. 
  
     you are old, said the youth, as i mentioned before, 
       and have grown most uncommonly fat 
     yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door 
       pray, what is the reason of that 
  
     in my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks, 
       i kept all my limbs very supple 
     by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box 
       allow me to sell you a couple 
  
     you are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak 
       for anything tougher than suet 
     yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak 
       pray how did you manage to do it 
  
     in my youth, said his father, i took to the law, 
       and argued each case with my wife 
     and the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, 
       has lasted the rest of my life. 
  
     you are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose 
       that your eye was as steady as ever 
     yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose 
       what made you so awfully clever 
  
     i have answered three questions, and that is enough, 
       said his father dont give yourself airs 
     do you think i can listen all day to such stuff 
       be off, or ill kick you down stairs 
  
  
   that is not said right, said the caterpillar. 
  
   not quite right, im afraid, said alice, timidly some of the 
 words have got altered. 
  
   it is wrong from beginning to end, said the caterpillar 
 decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. 
  
   the caterpillar was the first to speak. 
  
   what size do you want to be it asked. 
  
   oh, im not particular as to size, alice hastily replied 
 only one doesnt like changing so often, you know. 
  
   i dont know, said the caterpillar. 
  
   alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in 
 her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper. 
  
   are you content now said the caterpillar. 
  
   well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if you 
 wouldnt mind, said alice  three inches is such a wretched 
 height to be. 
  
   it is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar 
 angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three 
 inches high). 
  
   but im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone. 
 and she thought of herself, i wish the creatures wouldnt be so 
 easily offended 
  
   youll get used to it in time, said the caterpillar and it 
 put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. 
  
   this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. 
 in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its 
 mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  then it got 
 down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely 
 remarking as it went, one side will make you grow taller, and 
 the other side will make you grow shorter. 
  
   one side of what  the other side of what thought alice to 
 herself. 
  
   of the mushroom, said the caterpillar, just as if she had 
 asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight. 
  
   alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a 
 minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as 
 it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. 
 however, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they 
 would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. 
  
   and now which is which she said to herself, and nibbled a 
 little of the righthand bit to try the effect  the next moment 
 she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her 
 foot 
  
   she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but 
 she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking 
 rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. 
 her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was 
 hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last, and 
 managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit. 
  
  
                                                 
  
                                              
  
                                                 
  
   come, my heads free at last said alice in a tone of 
 delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she 
 found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could 
 see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which 
 seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay 
 far below her. 
  
   what can all that green stuff be said alice.  and where 
 have my shoulders got to  and oh, my poor hands, how is it i 
 cant see you  she was moving them about as she spoke, but no 
 result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the 
 distant green leaves. 
  
   as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her 
 head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted 
 to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, 
 like a serpent.  she had just succeeded in curving it down into a 
 graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which 
 she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she 
 had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a 
 hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating 
 her violently with its wings. 
  
   serpent screamed the pigeon. 
  
   im not a serpent said alice indignantly.  let me alone 
  
   serpent, i say again repeated the pigeon, but in a more 
 subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, ive tried every 
 way, and nothing seems to suit them 
  
   i havent the least idea what youre talking about, said 
 alice. 
  
   ive tried the roots of trees, and ive tried banks, and ive 
 tried hedges, the pigeon went on, without attending to her but 
 those serpents  theres no pleasing them 
  
   alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no 
 use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished. 
  
   as if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the 
 pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and 
 day  why, i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks 
  
   im very sorry youve been annoyed, said alice, who was 
 beginning to see its meaning. 
  
   and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood, continued 
 the pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as i was 
 thinking i should be free of them at last, they must needs come 
 wriggling down from the sky  ugh, serpent 
  
   but im not a serpent, i tell you said alice.  im aim 
 a 
  
   well  what are you said the pigeon.  i can see youre 
 trying to invent something 
  
   iim a little girl, said alice, rather doubtfully, as she 
 remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day. 
  
   a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the 
 deepest contempt.  ive seen a good many little girls in my 
 time, but never one with such a neck as that  no, no  youre a 
 serpent and theres no use denying it.  i suppose youll be 
 telling me next that you never tasted an egg 
  
   i have tasted eggs, certainly, said alice, who was a very 
 truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as 
 serpents do, you know. 
  
   i dont believe it, said the pigeon but if they do, why 
 then theyre a kind of serpent, thats all i can say. 
  
   this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent 
 for a minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of 
 adding, youre looking for eggs, i know that well enough and 
 what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a 
 serpent 
  
   it matters a good deal to me, said alice hastily but im 
 not looking for eggs, as it happens and if i was, i shouldnt 
 want yours  i dont like them raw. 
  
   well, be off, then said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it 
 settled down again into its nest.  alice crouched down among the 
 trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled 
 among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and 
 untwist it.  after a while she remembered that she still held the 
 pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very 
 carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and 
 growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had 
 succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height. 
  
   it was so long since she had been anything near the right size, 
 that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a 
 few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  come, 
 theres half my plan done now  how puzzling all these changes 
 are  im never sure what im going to be, from one minute to 
 another  however, ive got back to my right size  the next 
 thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be 
 done, i wonder  as she said this, she came suddenly upon an 
 open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 
 whoever lives there, thought alice, itll never do to come 
 upon them this size  why, i should frighten them out of their 
 wits  so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did 
 not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself 
 down to nine inches high. 
  
  
  
                            chapter vi 
  
                          pig and pepper 
  
  
   for a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and 
 wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came 
 running out of the wood(she considered him to be a footman 
 because he was in livery  otherwise, judging by his face only, 
 she would have called him a fish)and rapped loudly at the door 
 with his knuckles.  it was opened by another footman in livery, 
 with a round face, and large eyes like a frog and both footmen, 
 alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their 
 heads.  she felt very curious to know what it was all about, and 
 crept a little way out of the wood to listen. 
  
   the fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great 
 letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to 
 the other, saying, in a solemn tone, for the duchess.  an 
 invitation from the queen to play croquet.  the frogfootman 
 repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the 
 words a little, from the queen.  an invitation for the duchess 
 to play croquet. 
  
   then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled 
 together. 
  
   alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into 
 the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped 
 out the fishfootman was gone, and the other was sitting on the 
 ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky. 
  
   alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. 
  
   theres no sort of use in knocking, said the footman, and 
 that for two reasons.  first, because im on the same side of the 
 door as you are secondly, because theyre making such a noise 
 inside, no one could possibly hear you.  and certainly there was 
 a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling 
 and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish 
 or kettle had been broken to pieces. 
  
   please, then, said alice, how am i to get in 
  
   there might be some sense in your knocking, the footman went 
 on without attending to her, if we had the door between us.  for 
 instance, if you were inside, you might knock, and i could let 
 you out, you know.  he was looking up into the sky all the time 
 he was speaking, and this alice thought decidedly uncivil.  but 
 perhaps he cant help it, she said to herself his eyes are so 
 very nearly at the top of his head.  but at any rate he might 
 answer questions.how am i to get in she repeated, aloud. 
  
   i shall sit here, the footman remarked, till tomorrow 
  
   at this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate 
 came skimming out, straight at the footmans head  it just 
 grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees 
 behind him. 
  
   or next day, maybe, the footman continued in the same tone, 
 exactly as if nothing had happened. 
  
   how am i to get in asked alice again, in a louder tone. 
  
   are you to get in at all said the footman.  thats the 
 first question, you know. 
  
   it was, no doubt  only alice did not like to be told so. 
 its really dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the 
 creatures argue.  its enough to drive one crazy 
  
   the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for 
 repeating his remark, with variations.  i shall sit here, he 
 said, on and off, for days and days. 
  
   but what am i to do said alice. 
  
   anything you like, said the footman, and began whistling. 
  
   oh, theres no use in talking to him, said alice desperately 
 hes perfectly idiotic  and she opened the door and went in. 
  
   the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of 
 smoke from one end to the other  the duchess was sitting on a 
 threelegged stool in the middle, nursing a baby the cook was 
 leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to 
 be full of soup. 
  
   theres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to 
 herself, as well as she could for sneezing. 
  
   there was certainly too much of it in the air.  even the 
 duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby, it was 
 sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause.  the 
 only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, 
 and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from 
 ear to ear. 
  
   please would you tell me, said alice, a little timidly, for 
 she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to 
 speak first, why your cat grins like that 
  
   its a cheshire cat, said the duchess, and thats why. 
 pig 
  
   she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice 
 quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed 
 to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on 
 again 
  
   i didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact, i 
 didnt know that cats could grin. 
  
   they all can, said the duchess and most of em do. 
  
   i dont know of any that do, alice said very politely, 
 feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. 
  
   you dont know much, said the duchess and thats a fact. 
  
   alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought 
 it would be as well to introduce some other subject of 
 conversation.  while she was trying to fix on one, the cook took 
 the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work 
 throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby 
 the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans, 
 plates, and dishes.  the duchess took no notice of them even when 
 they hit her and the baby was howling so much already, that it 
 was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. 
  
   oh, please mind what youre doing cried alice, jumping up 
 and down in an agony of terror.  oh, there goes his precious 
 nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very 
 nearly carried it off. 
  
   if everybody minded their own business, the duchess said in a 
 hoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it 
 does. 
  
   which would not be an advantage, said alice, who felt very 
 glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her 
 knowledge.  just think of what work it would make with the day 
 and night  you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn 
 round on its axis 
  
   talking of axes, said the duchess, chop off her head 
  
   alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant 
 to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and 
 seemed not to be listening, so she went on again  twentyfour 
 hours, i think or is it twelve  i 
  
   oh, dont bother me, said the duchess i never could abide 
 figures  and with that she began nursing her child again, 
 singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a 
 violent shake at the end of every line 
  
         speak roughly to your little boy, 
           and beat him when he sneezes 
         he only does it to annoy, 
           because he knows it teases. 
  
                     chorus. 
  
     (in which the cook and the baby joined) 
  
                 wow wow wow 
  
   while the duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept 
 tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing 
 howled so, that alice could hardly hear the words 
  
         i speak severely to my boy, 
           i beat him when he sneezes 
         for he can thoroughly enjoy 
           the pepper when he pleases 
  
                     chorus. 
  
                 wow wow wow 
  
   here you may nurse it a bit, if you like the duchess said 
 to alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  i must go and 
 get ready to play croquet with the queen, and she hurried out of 
 the room.  the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out, 
 but it just missed her. 
  
   alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer 
 shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all 
 directions, just like a starfish, thought alice.  the poor 
 little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it, 
 and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, 
 so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much 
 as she could do to hold it. 
  
   as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, 
 (which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep 
 tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its 
 undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  if i 
 dont take this child away with me, thought alice, theyre sure 
 to kill it in a day or two  wouldnt it be murder to leave it 
 behind  she said the last words out loud, and the little thing 
 grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  dont 
 grunt, said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing 
 yourself. 
  
   the baby grunted again, and alice looked very anxiously into 
 its face to see what was the matter with it.  there could be no 
 doubt that it had a very turnup nose, much more like a snout 
 than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for 
 a baby  altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at 
 all.  but perhaps it was only sobbing, she thought, and looked 
 into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears. 
  
   no, there were no tears.  if youre going to turn into a pig, 
 my dear, said alice, seriously, ill have nothing more to do 
 with you.  mind now  the poor little thing sobbed again (or 
 grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for 
 some while in silence. 
  
   alice was just beginning to think to herself, now, what am i 
 to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted 
 again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some 
 alarm.  this time there could be no mistake about it  it was 
 neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be 
 quite absurd for her to carry it further. 
  
   so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to 
 see it trot away quietly into the wood.  if it had grown up, 
 she said to herself, it would have made a dreadfully ugly child 
 but it makes rather a handsome pig, i think.  and she began 
 thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as 
 pigs, and was just saying to herself, if one only knew the right 
 way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing 
 the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. 
  
   the cat only grinned when it saw alice.  it looked good 
 natured, she thought  still it had very long claws and a great 
 many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. 
  
   cheshire puss, she began, rather timidly, as she did not at 
 all know whether it would like the name  however, it only 
 grinned a little wider.  come, its pleased so far, thought 
 alice, and she went on.  would you tell me, please, which way i 
 ought to go from here 
  
   that depends a good deal on where you want to get to, said 
 the cat. 
  
   i dont much care where said alice. 
  
   then it doesnt matter which way you go, said the cat. 
  
   so long as i get somewhere, alice added as an explanation. 
  
   oh, youre sure to do that, said the cat, if you only walk 
 long enough. 
  
   alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another 
 question.  what sort of people live about here 
  
   in that direction, the cat said, waving its right paw round, 
 lives a hatter  and in that direction, waving the other paw, 
 lives a march hare.  visit either you like  theyre both mad. 
  
   but i dont want to go among mad people, alice remarked. 
  
   oh, you cant help that, said the cat  were all mad here. 
 im mad.  youre mad. 
  
   how do you know im mad said alice. 
  
   you must be, said the cat, or you wouldnt have come here. 
  
   alice didnt think that proved it at all however, she went on 
 and how do you know that youre mad 
  
   to begin with, said the cat, a dogs not mad.  you grant 
 that 
  
   i suppose so, said alice. 
  
   well, then, the cat went on, you see, a dog growls when its 
 angry, and wags its tail when its pleased.  now i growl when im 
 pleased, and wag my tail when im angry.  therefore im mad. 
  
   i call it purring, not growling, said alice. 
  
   call it what you like, said the cat.  do you play croquet 
 with the queen today 
  
   i should like it very much, said alice, but i havent been 
 invited yet. 
  
   youll see me there, said the cat, and vanished. 
  
   alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used 
 to queer things happening.  while she was looking at the place 
 where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. 
  
   bythebye, what became of the baby said the cat.  id 
 nearly forgotten to ask. 
  
   it turned into a pig, alice quietly said, just as if it had 
 come back in a natural way. 
  
   i thought it would, said the cat, and vanished again. 
  
   alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it 
 did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the 
 direction in which the march hare was said to live.  ive seen 
 hatters before, she said to herself the march hare will be 
 much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is may it wont be 
 raving madat least not so mad as it was in march.  as she said 
 this, she looked up, and there was the cat again, sitting on a 
 branch of a tree. 
  
   did you say pig, or fig said the cat. 
  
   i said pig, replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep 
 appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy. 
  
   all right, said the cat and this time it vanished quite 
 slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the 
 grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. 
  
   well  ive often seen a cat without a grin, thought alice 
 but a grin without a cat  its the most curious thing i ever 
 say in my life 
  
   she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the 
 house of the march hare  she thought it must be the right house, 
 because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was 
 thatched with fur.  it was so large a house, that she did not 
 like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand 
 bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high  even 
 then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself 
 suppose it should be raving mad after all  i almost wish id 
 gone to see the hatter instead 
  
  
  
                            chapter vii 
  
                          a mad teaparty 
  
  
   there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, 
 and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a 
 dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two 
 were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and the 
 talking over its head.  very uncomfortable for the dormouse, 
 thought alice only, as its asleep, i suppose it doesnt mind. 
  
   the table was a large one, but the three were all crowded 
 together at one corner of it  no room  no room they cried 
 out when they saw alice coming.  theres plenty of room said 
 alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large armchair at one 
 end of the table. 
  
   have some wine, the march hare said in an encouraging tone. 
  
   alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it 
 but tea.  i dont see any wine, she remarked. 
  
   there isnt any, said the march hare. 
  
   then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it, said alice 
 angrily. 
  
   it wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being 
 invited, said the march hare. 
  
   i didnt know it was your table, said alice its laid for a 
 great many more than three. 
  
   your hair wants cutting, said the hatter.  he had been 
 looking at alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was 
 his first speech. 
  
   you should learn not to make personal remarks, alice said 
 with some severity its very rude. 
  
   the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all 
 he said was, why is a raven like a writingdesk 
  
   come, we shall have some fun now thought alice.  im glad 
 theyve begun asking riddles.i believe i can guess that, she 
 added aloud. 
  
   do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it 
 said the march hare. 
  
   exactly so, said alice. 
  
   then you should say what you mean, the march hare went on. 
  
   i do, alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean what 
 i saythats the same thing, you know. 
  
   not the same thing a bit said the hatter.  you might just 
 as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat 
 what i see 
  
   you might just as well say, added the march hare, that i 
 like what i get is the same thing as i get what i like 
  
   you might just as well say, added the dormouse, who seemed to 
 be talking in his sleep, that i breathe when i sleep is the 
 same thing as i sleep when i breathe 
  
   it is the same thing with you, said the hatter, and here the 
 conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, 
 while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and 
 writingdesks, which wasnt much. 
  
   the hatter was the first to break the silence.  what day of 
 the month is it he said, turning to alice  he had taken his 
 watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking 
 it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. 
  
   alice considered a little, and then said the fourth. 
  
   two days wrong sighed the hatter.  i told you butter 
 wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march 
 hare. 
  
   it was the best butter, the march hare meekly replied. 
  
   yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well, the hatter 
 grumbled  you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife. 
  
   the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then 
 he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again  but he 
 could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, it 
 was the best butter, you know. 
  
   alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. 
 what a funny watch she remarked.  it tells the day of the 
 month, and doesnt tell what oclock it is 
  
   why should it muttered the hatter.  does your watch tell 
 you what year it is 
  
   of course not, alice replied very readily  but thats 
 because it stays the same year for such a long time together. 
  
   which is just the case with mine, said the hatter. 
  
   alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  the hatters remark seemed to 
 have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english. 
 i dont quite understand you, she said, as politely as she 
 could. 
  
   the dormouse is asleep again, said the hatter, and he poured 
 a little hot tea upon its nose. 
  
   the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without 
 opening its eyes, of course, of course just what i was going to 
 remark myself. 
  
   have you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said, turning to 
 alice again. 
  
   no, i give it up, alice replied  whats the answer 
  
   i havent the slightest idea, said the hatter. 
  
   nor i, said the march hare. 
  
   alice sighed wearily.  i think you might do something better 
 with the time, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that 
 have no answers. 
  
   if you knew time as well as i do, said the hatter, you 
 wouldnt talk about wasting it.  its him. 
  
   i dont know what you mean, said alice. 
  
   of course you dont the hatter said, tossing his head 
 contemptuously.  i dare say you never even spoke to time 
  
   perhaps not, alice cautiously replied  but i know i have to 
 beat time when i learn music. 
  
   ah that accounts for it, said the hatter.  he wont stand 
 beating.  now, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do 
 almost anything you liked with the clock.  for instance, suppose 
 it were nine oclock in the morning, just time to begin lessons 
 youd only have to whisper a hint to time, and round goes the 
 clock in a twinkling  halfpast one, time for dinner 
  
   (i only wish it was, the march hare said to itself in a 
 whisper.) 
  
   that would be grand, certainly, said alice thoughtfully 
 but theni shouldnt be hungry for it, you know. 
  
   not at first, perhaps, said the hatter  but you could keep 
 it to halfpast one as long as you liked. 
  
   is that the way you manage alice asked. 
  
   the hatter shook his head mournfully.  not i he replied. 
 we quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad, you know 
 (pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare,) it was at the 
 great concert given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing 
  
             twinkle, twinkle, little bat 
             how i wonder what youre at 
  
 you know the song, perhaps 
  
   ive heard something like it, said alice. 
  
   it goes on, you know, the hatter continued, in this way 
  
             up above the world you fly, 
             like a teatray in the sky. 
                     twinkle, twinkle 
  
 here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep 
 twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle and went on so long that 
 they had to pinch it to make it stop. 
  
   well, id hardly finished the first verse, said the hatter, 
 when the queen jumped up and bawled out, hes murdering the 
 time  off with his head 
  
   how dreadfully savage exclaimed alice. 
  
   and ever since that, the hatter went on in a mournful tone, 
 he wont do a thing i ask  its always six oclock now. 
  
   a bright idea came into alices head.  is that the reason so 
 many teathings are put out here she asked. 
  
   yes, thats it, said the hatter with a sigh  its always 
 teatime, and weve no time to wash the things between whiles. 
  
   then you keep moving round, i suppose said alice. 
  
   exactly so, said the hatter  as the things get used up. 
  
   but what happens when you come to the beginning again alice 
 ventured to ask. 
  
   suppose we change the subject, the march hare interrupted, 
 yawning.  im getting tired of this.  i vote the young lady 
 tells us a story. 
  
   im afraid i dont know one, said alice, rather alarmed at 
 the proposal. 
  
   then the dormouse shall they both cried.  wake up, 
 dormouse  and they pinched it on both sides at once. 
  
   the dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  i wasnt asleep, he 
 said in a hoarse, feeble voice  i heard every word you fellows 
 were saying. 
  
   tell us a story said the march hare. 
  
   yes, please do pleaded alice. 
  
   and be quick about it, added the hatter, or youll be asleep 
 again before its done. 
  
   once upon a time there were three little sisters, the 
 dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie, 
 lacie, and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well 
  
   what did they live on said alice, who always took a great 
 interest in questions of eating and drinking. 
  
   they lived on treacle, said the dormouse, after thinking a 
 minute or two. 
  
   they couldnt have done that, you know, alice gently 
 remarked theyd have been ill. 
  
   so they were, said the dormouse very ill. 
  
   alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways 
 of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went 
 on  but why did they live at the bottom of a well 
  
   take some more tea, the march hare said to alice, very 
 earnestly. 
  
   ive had nothing yet, alice replied in an offended tone, so 
 i cant take more. 
  
   you mean you cant take less, said the hatter  its very 
 easy to take more than nothing. 
  
   nobody asked your opinion, said alice. 
  
   whos making personal remarks now the hatter asked 
 triumphantly. 
  
   alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped 
 herself to some tea and breadandbutter, and then turned to the 
 dormouse, and repeated her question.  why did they live at the 
 bottom of a well 
  
   the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and 
 then said, it was a treaclewell. 
  
   theres no such thing  alice was beginning very angrily, but 
 the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse 
 sulkily remarked, if you cant be civil, youd better finish the 
 story for yourself. 
  
   no, please go on alice said very humbly i wont interrupt 
 again.  i dare say there may be one. 
  
   one, indeed said the dormouse indignantly.  however, he 
 consented to go on.  and so these three little sistersthey 
 were learning to draw, you know 
  
   what did they draw said alice, quite forgetting her promise. 
  
   treacle, said the dormouse, without considering at all this 
 time. 
  
   i want a clean cup, interrupted the hatter  lets all move 
 one place on. 
  
   he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him  the 
 march hare moved into the dormouses place, and alice rather 
 unwillingly took the place of the march hare.  the hatter was the 
 only one who got any advantage from the change  and alice was a 
 good deal worse off than before, as the march hare had just upset 
 the milkjug into his plate. 
  
   alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began 
 very cautiously  but i dont understand.  where did they draw 
 the treacle from 
  
   you can draw water out of a waterwell, said the hatter so 
 i should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh, 
 stupid 
  
   but they were in the well, alice said to the dormouse, not 
 choosing to notice this last remark. 
  
   of course they were, said the dormouse well in. 
  
   this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormouse 
 go on for some time without interrupting it. 
  
   they were learning to draw, the dormouse went on, yawning and 
 rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy and they drew 
 all manner of thingseverything that begins with an m 
  
   why with an m said alice. 
  
   why not said the march hare. 
  
   alice was silent. 
  
   the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going 
 off into a doze but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up 
 again with a little shriek, and went on  that begins with an 
 m, such as mousetraps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness 
 you know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever 
 see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness 
  
   really, now you ask me, said alice, very much confused, i 
 dont think 
  
   then you shouldnt talk, said the hatter. 
  
   this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got 
 up in great disgust, and walked off the dormouse fell asleep 
 instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her 
 going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that 
 they would call after her  the last time she saw them, they were 
 trying to put the dormouse into the teapot. 
  
   at any rate ill never go there again said alice as she 
 picked her way through the wood.  its the stupidest teaparty i 
 ever was at in all my life 
  
   just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a 
 door leading right into it.  thats very curious she thought. 
 but everythings curious today.  i think i may as well go in at 
 once.  and in she went. 
  
   once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the 
 little glass table.  now, ill manage better this time, she 
 said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and 
 unlocking the door that led into the garden.  then she went to 
 work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her 
 pocked) till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the 
 little passage  and thenshe found herself at last in the 
 beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool 
 fountains. 
  
  
  
                           chapter viii 
  
                    the queens croquetground 
  
  
   a large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden  the 
 roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at 
 it, busily painting them red.  alice thought this a very curious 
 thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up 
 to them she heard one of them say, look out now, five  dont go 
 splashing paint over me like that 
  
   i couldnt help it, said five, in a sulky tone seven jogged 
 my elbow. 
  
   on which seven looked up and said, thats right, five  always 
 lay the blame on others 
  
   youd better not talk said five.  i heard the queen say only 
 yesterday you deserved to be beheaded 
  
   what for said the one who had spoken first. 
  
   thats none of your business, two said seven. 
  
   yes, it is his business said five, and ill tell himit 
 was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions. 
  
   seven flung down his brush, and had just begun well, of all 
 the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice, as 
 she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly  the 
 others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. 
  
   would you tell me, said alice, a little timidly, why you are 
 painting those roses 
  
   five and seven said nothing, but looked at two.  two began in a 
 low voice, why the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought to 
 have been a red rosetree, and we put a white one in by mistake 
 and if the queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads 
 cut off, you know.  so you see, miss, were doing our best, afore 
 she comes, to  at this moment five, who had been anxiously 
 looking across the garden, called out the queen  the queen 
 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon 
 their faces.  there was a sound of many footsteps, and alice 
 looked round, eager to see the queen. 
  
   first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped 
 like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and 
 feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers these were 
 ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the 
 soldiers did.  after these came the royal children there were 
 ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand 
 in hand, in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts.  next 
 came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among them alice 
 recognised the white rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous 
 manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without 
 noticing her.  then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the 
 kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and, last of all this 
 grand procession, came the king and queen of hearts. 
  
   alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on 
 her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember 
 every having heard of such a rule at processions and besides, 
 what would be the use of a procession, thought she, if people 
 had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldnt see 
 it  so she stood still where she was, and waited. 
  
   when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped 
 and looked at her, and the queen said severely who is this 
 she said it to the knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in 
 reply. 
  
   idiot said the queen, tossing her head impatiently and, 
 turning to alice, she went on, whats your name, child 
  
   my name is alice, so please your majesty, said alice very 
 politely but she added, to herself, why, theyre only a pack of 
 cards, after all.  i neednt be afraid of them 
  
   and who are these said the queen, pointing to the three 
 gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for, you see, as 
 they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs 
 was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether 
 they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her 
 own children. 
  
   how should i know said alice, surprised at her own courage. 
 its no business of mine. 
  
   the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her 
 for a moment like a wild beast, screamed off with her head 
 off 
  
   nonsense said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the 
 queen was silent. 
  
   the king laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said 
 consider, my dear  she is only a child 
  
   the queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the knave 
 turn them over 
  
   the knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. 
  
   get up said the queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the 
 three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the 
 king, the queen, the royal children, and everybody else. 
  
   leave off that screamed the queen.  you make me giddy. 
 and then, turning to the rosetree, she went on, what have you 
 been doing here 
  
   may it please your majesty, said two, in a very humble tone, 
 going down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying 
  
   i see said the queen, who had meanwhile been examining the 
 roses.  off with their heads and the procession moved on, 
 three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate 
 gardeners, who ran to alice for protection. 
  
   you shant be beheaded said alice, and she put them into a 
 large flowerpot that stood near.  the three soldiers wandered 
 about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly 
 marched off after the others. 
  
   are their heads off shouted the queen. 
  
   their heads are gone, if it please your majesty the soldiers 
 shouted in reply. 
  
   thats right shouted the queen.  can you play croquet 
  
   the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question 
 was evidently meant for her. 
  
   yes shouted alice. 
  
   come on, then roared the queen, and alice joined the 
 procession, wondering very much what would happen next. 
  
   itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side. 
 she was walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously 
 into her face. 
  
   very, said alice  wheres the duchess 
  
   hush  hush said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  he 
 looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised 
 himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and 
 whispered shes under sentence of execution. 
  
   what for said alice. 
  
   did you say what a pity the rabbit asked. 
  
   no, i didnt, said alice  i dont think its at all a pity. 
 i said what for 
  
   she boxed the queens ears the rabbit began.  alice gave a 
 little scream of laughter.  oh, hush the rabbit whispered in a 
 frightened tone.  the queen will hear you  you see, she came 
 rather late, and the queen said 
  
   get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder, 
 and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up 
 against each other however, they got settled down in a minute or 
 two, and the game began.  alice thought she had never seen such a 
 curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and 
 furrows the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live 
 flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to 
 stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches. 
  
   the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her 
 flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, 
 comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, 
 but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened 
 out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it 
 would twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a 
 puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing 
 and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again, 
 it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled 
 itself, and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this, 
 there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she 
 wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubledup soldiers 
 were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the 
 ground, alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very 
 difficult game indeed. 
  
   the players all played at once without waiting for turns, 
 quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs and in 
 a very short time the queen was in a furious passion, and went 
 stamping about, and shouting off with his head or off with 
 her head about once in a minute. 
  
   alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure, she had not as 
 yet had any dispute with the queen, but she knew that it might 
 happen any minute, and then, thought she, what would become of 
 me  theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great 
 wonder is, that theres any one left alive 
  
   she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering 
 whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a 
 curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at 
 first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to 
 be a grin, and she said to herself its the cheshire cat  now i 
 shall have somebody to talk to. 
  
   how are you getting on said the cat, as soon as there was 
 mouth enough for it to speak with. 
  
   alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  its no 
 use speaking to it, she thought, till its ears have come, or at 
 least one of them.  in another minute the whole head appeared, 
 and then alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the 
 game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  the 
 cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and 
 no more of it appeared. 
  
   i dont think they play at all fairly, alice began, in rather 
 a complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant 
 hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in 
 particular at least, if there are, nobody attends to themand 
 youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive 
 for instance, theres the arch ive got to go through next 
 walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have 
 croqueted the queens hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it 
 saw mine coming 
  
   how do you like the queen said the cat in a low voice. 
  
   not at all, said alice  shes so extremely  just then 
 she noticed that the queen was close behind her, listening  so 
 she went on, likely to win, that its hardly worth while 
 finishing the game. 
  
   the queen smiled and passed on. 
  
   who are you talking to said the king, going up to alice, and 
 looking at the cats head with great curiosity. 
  
   its a friend of minea cheshire cat, said alice  allow me 
 to introduce it. 
  
   i dont like the look of it at all, said the king  however, 
 it may kiss my hand if it likes. 
  
   id rather not, the cat remarked. 
  
   dont be impertinent, said the king, and dont look at me 
 like that  he got behind alice as he spoke. 
  
   a cat may look at a king, said alice.  ive read that in 
 some book, but i dont remember where. 
  
   well, it must be removed, said the king very decidedly, and 
 he called the queen, who was passing at the moment, my dear  i 
 wish you would have this cat removed 
  
   the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great 
 or small.  off with his head she said, without even looking 
 round. 
  
   ill fetch the executioner myself, said the king eagerly, and 
 he hurried off. 
  
   alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game 
 was going on, as she heard the queens voice in the distance, 
 screaming with passion.  she had already heard her sentence three 
 of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and 
 she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in 
 such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or 
 not.  so she went in search of her hedgehog. 
  
   the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, 
 which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one 
 of them with the other  the only difficulty was, that her 
 flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where 
 alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up 
 into a tree. 
  
   by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, 
 the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight 
 but it doesnt matter much, thought alice, as all the arches 
 are gone from this side of the ground.  so she tucked it away 
 under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for 
 a little more conversation with her friend. 
  
   when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to 
 find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute 
 going on between the executioner, the king, and the queen, who 
 were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, 
 and looked very uncomfortable. 
  
   the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to 
 settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, 
 though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed 
 to make out exactly what they said. 
  
   the executioners argument was, that you couldnt cut off a 
 head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had 
 never had to do such a thing before, and he wasnt going to begin 
 at his time of life. 
  
   the kings argument was, that anything that had a head could be 
 beheaded, and that you werent to talk nonsense. 
  
   the queens argument was, that if something wasnt done about 
 it in less than no time shed have everybody executed, all round. 
 (it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so 
 grave and anxious.) 
  
   alice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the 
 duchess  youd better ask her about it. 
  
   shes in prison, the queen said to the executioner  fetch 
 her here.  and the executioner went off like an arrow. 
  
    the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, 
 by the time he had come back with the dutchess, it had entirely 
 disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and 
 down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game. 
  
  
  
                            chapter ix 
  
                      the mock turtles story 
  
  
   you cant think how glad i am to see you again, you dear old 
 thing said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately 
 into alices, and they walked off together. 
  
   alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and 
 thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had 
 made her so savage when they met in the kitchen. 
  
   when im a duchess, she said to herself, (not in a very 
 hopeful tone though), i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at 
 all.  soup does very well withoutmaybe its always pepper that 
 makes people hottempered, she went on, very much pleased at 
 having found out a new kind of rule, and vinegar that makes them 
 sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar 
 and such things that make children sweettempered.  i only wish 
 people knew that  then they wouldnt be so stingy about it, you 
 know 
  
   she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was a 
 little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 
 youre thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you 
 forget to talk.  i cant tell you just now what the moral of that 
 is, but i shall remember it in a bit. 
  
   perhaps it hasnt one, alice ventured to remark. 
  
   tut, tut, child said the duchess.  everythings got a 
 moral, if only you can find it.  and she squeezed herself up 
 closer to alices side as she spoke. 
  
   alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first, 
 because the duchess was very ugly and secondly, because she was 
 exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder, 
 and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  however, she did not 
 like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could. 
  
   the games going on rather better now, she said, by way of 
 keeping up the conversation a little. 
  
   tis so, said the duchess  and the moral of that isoh, 
 tis love, tis love, that makes the world go round 
  
   somebody said, alice whispered, that its done by everybody 
 minding their own business 
  
   ah, well  it means much the same thing, said the duchess, 
 digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added, 
 and the moral of that istake care of the sense, and the 
 sounds will take care of themselves. 
  
   how fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to 
 herself. 
  
   i dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your 
 waist, the duchess said after a pause  the reason is, that im 
 doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  shall i try the 
 experiment 
  
   he might bite, alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all 
 anxious to have the experiment tried. 
  
   very true, said the duchess  flamingoes and mustard both 
 bite.  and the moral of that isbirds of a feather flock 
 together. 
  
   only mustard isnt a bird, alice remarked. 
  
   right, as usual, said the duchess  what a clear way you 
 have of putting things 
  
   its a mineral, i think, said alice. 
  
   of course it is, said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree 
 to everything that alice said theres a large mustardmine near 
 here.  and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine, the 
 less there is of yours. 
  
   oh, i know exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this 
 last remark, its a vegetable.  it doesnt look like one, but it 
 is. 
  
   i quite agree with you, said the duchess and the moral of 
 that isbe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put 
 more simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than 
 what it might appear to others that what you were or might have 
 been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared 
 to them to be otherwise. 
  
   i think i should understand that better, alice said very 
 politely, if i had it written down  but i cant quite follow it 
 as you say it. 
  
   thats nothing to what i could say if i chose, the duchess 
 replied, in a pleased tone. 
  
   pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that, 
 said alice. 
  
   oh, dont talk about trouble said the duchess.  i make you 
 a present of everything ive said as yet. 
  
   a cheap sort of present thought alice.  im glad they dont 
 give birthday presents like that  but she did not venture to 
 say it out loud. 
  
   thinking again the duchess asked, with another dig of her 
 sharp little chin. 
  
   ive a right to think, said alice sharply, for she was 
 beginning to feel a little worried. 
  
   just about as much right, said the duchess, as pigs have to 
 fly and the m 
  
   but here, to alices great surprise, the duchesss voice died 
 away, even in the middle of her favourite word moral, and the 
 arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  alice looked up, 
 and there stood the queen in front of them, with her arms folded, 
 frowning like a thunderstorm. 
  
   a fine day, your majesty the duchess began in a low, weak 
 voice. 
  
   now, i give you fair warning, shouted the queen, stamping on 
 the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off, 
 and that in about half no time  take your choice 
  
   the duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. 
  
   lets go on with the game, the queen said to alice and alice 
 was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her 
 back to the croquetground. 
  
   the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence, 
 and were resting in the shade  however, the moment they saw her, 
 they hurried back to the game, the queen merely remarking that a 
 moments delay would cost them their lives. 
  
   all the time they were playing the queen never left off 
 quarrelling with the other players, and shouting off with his 
 head or off with her head  those whom she sentenced were 
 taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave 
 off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour 
 or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the 
 king, the queen, and alice, were in custody and under sentence of 
 execution. 
  
   then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to 
 alice, have you seen the mock turtle yet 
  
   no, said alice.  i dont even know what a mock turtle is. 
  
   its the thing mock turtle soup is made from, said the queen. 
  
   i never saw one, or heard of one, said alice. 
  
   come on, then, said the queen, and he shall tell you his 
 history, 
  
   as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low 
 voice, to the company generally, you are all pardoned.  come, 
 thats a good thing she said to herself, for she had felt quite 
 unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered. 
  
   they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in the 
 sun.  (if you dont know what a gryphon is, look at the picture.) 
 up, lazy thing said the queen, and take this young lady to 
 see the mock turtle, and to hear his history.  i must go back and 
 see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off, 
 leaving alice alone with the gryphon.  alice did not quite like 
 the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would 
 be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage 
 queen  so she waited. 
  
   the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the 
 queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled.  what fun 
 said the gryphon, half to itself, half to alice. 
  
   what is the fun said alice. 
  
   why, she, said the gryphon.  its all her fancy, that  they 
 never executes nobody, you know.  come on 
  
   everybody says come on here, thought alice, as she went 
 slowly after it  i never was so ordered about in all my life, 
 never 
  
   they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the 
 distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, 
 as they came nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart 
 would break.  she pitied him deeply.  what is his sorrow she 
 asked the gryphon, and the gryphon answered, very nearly in the 
 same words as before, its all his fancy, that  he hasnt got 
 no sorrow, you know.  come on 
  
   so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with 
 large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. 
  
   this here young lady, said the gryphon, she wants for to 
 know your history, she do. 
  
   ill tell it her, said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow 
 tone  sit down, both of you, and dont speak a word till ive 
 finished. 
  
   so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  alice 
 thought to herself, i dont see how he can even finish, if he 
 doesnt begin.  but she waited patiently. 
  
   once, said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, i was 
 a real turtle. 
  
   these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only 
 by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon, and 
 the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle.  alice was very 
 nearly getting up and saying, thank you, sir, for your 
 interesting story, but she could not help thinking there must be 
 more to come, so she sat still and said nothing. 
  
   when we were little, the mock turtle went on at last, more 
 calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, we went to 
 school in the sea.  the master was an old turtlewe used to call 
 him tortoise 
  
   why did you call him tortoise, if he wasnt one alice asked. 
  
   we called him tortoise because he taught us, said the mock 
 turtle angrily  really you are very dull 
  
   you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple 
 question, added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and 
 looked at poor alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  at 
 last the gryphon said to the mock turtle, drive on, old fellow 
 dont be all day about it and he went on in these words 
  
   yes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynt believe 
 it 
  
   i never said i didnt interrupted alice. 
  
   you did, said the mock turtle. 
  
   hold your tongue added the gryphon, before alice could speak 
 again.  the mock turtle went on. 
  
   we had the best of educationsin fact, we went to school 
 every day 
  
   ive been to a dayschool, too, said alice you neednt be 
 so proud as all that. 
  
   with extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiously. 
  
   yes, said alice, we learned french and music. 
  
   and washing said the mock turtle. 
  
   certainly not said alice indignantly. 
  
   ah then yours wasnt a really good school, said the mock 
 turtle in a tone of great relief.  now at ours they had at the 
 end of the bill, french, music, and washingextra. 
  
   you couldnt have wanted it much, said alice living at the 
 bottom of the sea. 
  
   i couldnt afford to learn it. said the mock turtle with a 
 sigh.  i only took the regular course. 
  
   what was that inquired alice. 
  
   reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with, the mock 
 turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic 
 ambition, distraction, uglification, and derision. 
  
   i never heard of uglification, alice ventured to say.  what 
 is it 
  
   the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  what  never 
 heard of uglifying it exclaimed.  you know what to beautify 
 is, i suppose 
  
   yes, said alice doubtfully  it meanstomakeanything 
 prettier. 
  
   well, then, the gryphon went on, if you dont know what to 
 uglify is, you are a simpleton. 
  
   alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about 
 it, so she turned to the mock turtle, and said what else had you 
 to learn 
  
   well, there was mystery, the mock turtle replied, counting 
 off the subjects on his flappers, mystery, ancient and modern, 
 with seaography  then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old 
 congereel, that used to come once a week  he taught us 
 drawling, stretching, and fainting in coils. 
  
   what was that like said alice. 
  
   well, i cant show it you myself, the mock turtle said  im 
 too stiff.  and the gryphon never learnt it. 
  
   hadnt time, said the gryphon  i went to the classics 
 master, though.  he was an old crab, he was. 
  
   i never went to him, the mock turtle said with a sigh  he 
 taught laughing and grief, they used to say. 
  
   so he did, so he did, said the gryphon, sighing in his turn 
 and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. 
  
   and how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice, in a 
 hurry to change the subject. 
  
   ten hours the first day, said the mock turtle nine the 
 next, and so on. 
  
   what a curious plan exclaimed alice. 
  
   thats the reason theyre called lessons, the gryphon 
 remarked  because they lessen from day to day. 
  
   this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a 
 little before she made her next remark.  then the eleventh day 
 must have been a holiday 
  
   of course it was, said the mock turtle. 
  
   and how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerly. 
  
   thats enough about lessons, the gryphon interrupted in a 
 very decided tone  tell her something about the games now. 
  
  
  
                             chapter x 
  
                       the lobster quadrille 
  
  
   the mock turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper 
 across his eyes.  he looked at alice, and tried to speak, but for 
 a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  same as if he had a bone 
 in his throat, said the gryphon  and it set to work shaking him 
 and punching him in the back.  at last the mock turtle recovered 
 his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on 
 again 
  
   you may not have lived much under the sea (i havent, 
 said alice)and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster 
 (alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily, 
 and said no, never) so you can have no idea what a delightful 
 thing a lobster quadrille is 
  
   no, indeed, said alice.  what sort of a dance is it 
  
   why, said the gryphon, you first form into a line along the 
 seashore 
  
   two lines cried the mock turtle.  seals, turtles, salmon, 
 and so on then, when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of 
 the way 
  
   that generally takes some time, interrupted the gryphon. 
  
   you advance twice 
  
   each with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphon. 
  
   of course, the mock turtle said  advance twice, set to 
 partners 
  
   change lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the 
 gryphon. 
  
   then, you know, the mock turtle went on, you throw the 
  
   the lobsters shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air. 
  
   as far out to sea as you can 
  
   swim after them screamed the gryphon. 
  
   turn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle, 
 capering wildly about. 
  
   back to land again, and thats all the first figure, said the 
 mock turtle, suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures, 
 who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat 
 down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at alice. 
  
   it must be a very pretty dance, said alice timidly. 
  
   would you like to see a little of it said the mock turtle. 
  
   very much indeed, said alice. 
  
   come, lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to the 
 gryphon.  we can do without lobsters, you know.  which shall 
 sing 
  
   oh, you sing, said the gryphon.  ive forgotten the words. 
  
   so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now 
 and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and 
 waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle 
 sang this, very slowly and sadly 
  
  
 will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail. 
 theres a porpoise close behind us, and hes treading on my 
  tail. 
 see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance 
 they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the 
 dance 
  
 will you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the 
 dance 
 will you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the 
 dance 
  
  
 you can really have no notion how delightful it will be 
 when they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to 
                                                       sea 
 but the snail replied too far, too far and gave a look 
                                                        askance 
 said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the 
    dance. 
     would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join 
         the dance. 
     would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join 
         the dance. 
  
 what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied. 
 there is another shore, you know, upon the other side. 
 the further off from england the nearer is to france 
 then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance. 
  
     will you, wont you, will you, wont you, will you join the 
          dance 
     will you, wont you, will you, wont you, wont you join the 
          dance 
  
  
  
   thank you, its a very interesting dance to watch, said 
 alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last  and i do so 
 like that curious song about the whiting 
  
   oh, as to the whiting, said the mock turtle, theyyouve 
 seen them, of course 
  
   yes, said alice, ive often seen them at dinn she 
 checked herself hastily. 
  
   i dont know where dinn may be, said the mock turtle, but 
 if youve seen them so often, of course you know what theyre 
 like. 
  
   i believe so, alice replied thoughtfully.  they have their 
 tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs. 
  
   youre wrong about the crumbs, said the mock turtle 
 crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  but they have their tails 
 in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle 
 yawned and shut his eyes.tell her about the reason and all 
 that, he said to the gryphon. 
  
   the reason is, said the gryphon, that they would go with 
 the lobsters to the dance.  so they got thrown out to sea.  so 
 they had to fall a long way.  so they got their tails fast in 
 their mouths.  so they couldnt get them out again.  thats all. 
  
   thank you, said alice, its very interesting.  i never knew 
 so much about a whiting before. 
  
   i can tell you more than that, if you like, said the 
 gryphon.  do you know why its called a whiting 
  
   i never thought about it, said alice.  why 
  
   it does the boots and shoes. the gryphon replied very 
 solemnly. 
  
   alice was thoroughly puzzled.  does the boots and shoes she 
 repeated in a wondering tone. 
  
   why, what are your shoes done with said the gryphon.  i 
 mean, what makes them so shiny 
  
   alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she 
 gave her answer.  theyre done with blacking, i believe. 
  
   boots and shoes under the sea, the gryphon went on in a deep 
 voice, are done with a whiting.  now you know. 
  
   and what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great 
 curiosity. 
  
   soles and eels, of course, the gryphon replied rather 
 impatiently  any shrimp could have told you that. 
  
   if id been the whiting, said alice, whose thoughts were 
 still running on the song, id have said to the porpoise, keep 
 back, please  we dont want you with us 
  
   they were obliged to have him with them, the mock turtle 
 said  no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise. 
  
   wouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surprise. 
  
   of course not, said the mock turtle  why, if a fish came 
 to me, and told me he was going a journey, i should say with 
 what porpoise 
  
   dont you mean purpose said alice. 
  
   i mean what i say, the mock turtle replied in an offended 
 tone.  and the gryphon added come, lets hear some of your 
 adventures. 
  
   i could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning, 
 said alice a little timidly  but its no use going back to 
 yesterday, because i was a different person then. 
  
   explain all that, said the mock turtle. 
  
   no, no  the adventures first, said the gryphon in an 
 impatient tone  explanations take such a dreadful time. 
  
   so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when 
 she first saw the white rabbit.  she was a little nervous about 
 it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on 
 each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she 
 gained courage as she went on.  her listeners were perfectly 
 quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old, 
 father william, to the caterpillar, and the words all coming 
 different, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath, and said 
 thats very curious. 
  
   its all about as curious as it can be, said the gryphon. 
  
   it all came different the mock turtle repeated 
 thoughtfully.  i should like to hear her try and repeat 
 something now.  tell her to begin.  he looked at the gryphon as 
 if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice. 
  
   stand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard, said 
 the gryphon. 
  
   how the creatures order one about, and make one repeat 
 lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once. 
 however, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so 
 full of the lobster quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was 
 saying, and the words came very queer indeed 
  
     tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare, 
     you have baked me too brown, i must sugar my hair. 
     as a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose 
     trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes. 
  
               later editions continued as follows 
     when the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, 
     and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark, 
     but, when the tide rises and sharks are around, 
     his voice has a timid and tremulous sound. 
  
   thats different from what i used to say when i was a child, 
 said the gryphon. 
  
   well, i never heard it before, said the mock turtle but it 
 sounds uncommon nonsense. 
  
   alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her 
 hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way 
 again. 
  
   i should like to have it explained, said the mock turtle. 
  
   she cant explain it, said the gryphon hastily.  go on with 
 the next verse. 
  
   but about his toes the mock turtle persisted.  how could 
 he turn them out with his nose, you know 
  
   its the first position in dancing. alice said but was 
 dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the 
 subject. 
  
   go on with the next verse, the gryphon repeated impatiently 
 it begins i passed by his garden. 
  
   alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would 
 all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice 
  
     i passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye, 
     how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie 
  
         later editions continued as follows 
     the panther took piecrust, and gravy, and meat, 
     while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat. 
     when the pie was all finished, the owl, as a boon, 
     was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon 
     while the panther received knife and fork with a growl, 
     and concluded the banquet 
  
   what is the use of repeating all that stuff, the mock turtle 
 interrupted, if you dont explain it as you go on  its by far 
 the most confusing thing i ever heard 
  
   yes, i think youd better leave off, said the gryphon  and 
 alice was only too glad to do so. 
  
   shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the 
 gryphon went on.  or would you like the mock turtle to sing you 
 a song 
  
   oh, a song, please, if the mock turtle would be so kind, 
 alice replied, so eagerly that the gryphon said, in a rather 
 offended tone, hm no accounting for tastes  sing her turtle 
 soup, will you, old fellow 
  
   the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes 
 choked with sobs, to sing this 
  
  
     beautiful soup, so rich and green, 
     waiting in a hot tureen 
     who for such dainties would not stoop 
     soup of the evening, beautiful soup 
     soup of the evening, beautiful soup 
         beauootiful soooop 
         beauootiful soooop 
     soooop of the eeevening, 
         beautiful, beautiful soup 
  
     beautiful soup  who cares for fish, 
     game, or any other dish 
     who would not give all else for two p 
     ennyworth only of beautiful soup 
     pennyworth only of beautiful soup 
         beauootiful soooop 
         beauootiful soooop 
     soooop of the eeevening, 
         beautiful, beautiful soup 
  
   chorus again cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle had 
 just begun to repeat it, when a cry of the trials beginning 
 was heard in the distance. 
  
   come on cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, 
 it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. 
  
   what trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon 
 only answered come on and ran the faster, while more and more 
 faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the 
 melancholy words 
  
     soooop of the eeevening, 
         beautiful, beautiful soup 
  
  
  
                            chapter xi 
  
                       who stole the tarts 
  
  
   the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when 
 they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts 
 of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards 
 the knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on 
 each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit, 
 with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the 
 other.  in the very middle of the court was a table, with a large 
 dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good, that it made alice 
 quite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the trial done, 
 she thought, and hand round the refreshments  but there seemed 
 to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about 
 her, to pass away the time. 
  
   alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had 
 read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that 
 she knew the name of nearly everything there.  thats the 
 judge, she said to herself, because of his great wig. 
  
   the judge, by the way, was the king and as he wore his crown 
 over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he 
 did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly 
 not becoming. 
  
   and thats the jurybox, thought alice, and those twelve 
 creatures, (she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because 
 some of them were animals, and some were birds,) i suppose they 
 are the jurors.  she said this last word two or three times over 
 to herself, being rather proud of it  for she thought, and 
 rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the 
 meaning of it at all.  however, jurymen would have done just 
 as well. 
  
   the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. 
 what are they doing  alice whispered to the gryphon.  they 
 cant have anything to put down yet, before the trials begun. 
  
   theyre putting down their names, the gryphon whispered in 
 reply, for fear they should forget them before the end of the 
 trial. 
  
   stupid things alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but 
 she stopped hastily, for the white rabbit cried out, silence in 
 the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked 
 anxiously round, to make out who was talking. 
  
   alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their 
 shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down stupid things 
 on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them 
 didnt know how to spell stupid, and that he had to ask his 
 neighbour to tell him.  a nice muddle their slatesll be in 
 before the trials over thought alice. 
  
   one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.  this of course, 
 alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got 
 behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it 
 away.  she did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was 
 bill, the lizard) could not make out at all what had become of 
 it so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write 
 with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very 
 little use, as it left no mark on the slate. 
  
   herald, read the accusation said the king. 
  
   on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and 
 then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows 
  
     the queen of hearts, she made some tarts, 
           all on a summer day 
       the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts, 
           and took them quite away 
  
   consider your verdict, the king said to the jury. 
  
   not yet, not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted.  theres 
 a great deal to come before that 
  
   call the first witness, said the king and the white rabbit 
 blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, first 
 witness 
  
   the first witness was the hatter.  he came in with a teacup in 
 one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other.  i beg 
 pardon, your majesty, he began, for bringing these in  but i 
 hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for. 
  
   you ought to have finished, said the king.  when did you 
 begin 
  
   the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into 
 the court, arminarm with the dormouse.  fourteenth of march, i 
 think it was, he said. 
  
   fifteenth, said the march hare. 
  
   sixteenth, added the dormouse. 
  
   write that down, the king said to the jury, and the jury 
 eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then 
 added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. 
  
   take off your hat, the king said to the hatter. 
  
   it isnt mine, said the hatter. 
  
   stolen the king exclaimed, turning to the jury, who 
 instantly made a memorandum of the fact. 
  
   i keep them to sell, the hatter added as an explanation 
 ive none of my own.  im a hatter. 
  
   here the queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the 
 hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. 
  
   give your evidence, said the king and dont be nervous, or 
 ill have you executed on the spot. 
  
   this did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept 
 shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the 
 queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his 
 teacup instead of the breadandbutter. 
  
   just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which 
 puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was 
 beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she 
 would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she 
 decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for 
 her. 
  
   i wish you wouldnt squeeze so. said the dormouse, who was 
 sitting next to her.  i can hardly breathe. 
  
   i cant help it, said alice very meekly  im growing. 
  
   youve no right to grow here, said the dormouse. 
  
   dont talk nonsense, said alice more boldly  you know 
 youre growing too. 
  
   yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace, said the dormouse 
 not in that ridiculous fashion.  and he got up very sulkily 
 and crossed over to the other side of the court. 
  
   all this time the queen had never left off staring at the 
 hatter, and, just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to 
 one of the officers of the court, bring me the list of the 
 singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter 
 trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off. 
  
   give your evidence, the king repeated angrily, or ill have 
 you executed, whether youre nervous or not. 
  
   im a poor man, your majesty, the hatter began, in a 
 trembling voice, and i hadnt begun my teanot above a week 
 or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand 
 the twinkling of the tea 
  
   the twinkling of the what said the king. 
  
   it began with the tea, the hatter replied. 
  
   of course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharply. 
 do you take me for a dunce  go on 
  
   im a poor man, the hatter went on, and most things 
 twinkled after thatonly the march hare said 
  
   i didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurry. 
  
   you did said the hatter. 
  
   i deny it said the march hare. 
  
   he denies it, said the king  leave out that part. 
  
   well, at any rate, the dormouse said the hatter went on, 
 looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the 
 dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. 
  
   after that, continued the hatter, i cut some more bread 
 andbutter 
  
   but what did the dormouse say one of the jury asked. 
  
   that i cant remember, said the hatter. 
  
   you must remember, remarked the king, or ill have you 
 executed. 
  
   the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter, 
 and went down on one knee.  im a poor man, your majesty, he 
 began. 
  
   youre a very poor speaker, said the king. 
  
   here one of the guineapigs cheered, and was immediately 
 suppressed by the officers of the court.  (as that is rather a 
 hard word, i will just explain to you how it was done.  they had 
 a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings 
 into this they slipped the guineapig, head first, and then sat 
 upon it.) 
  
   im glad ive seen that done, thought alice.  ive so often 
 read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, there was some 
 attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the 
 officers of the court, and i never understood what it meant 
 till now. 
  
   if thats all you know about it, you may stand down, 
 continued the king. 
  
   i cant go no lower, said the hatter  im on the floor, as 
 it is. 
  
   then you may sit down, the king replied. 
  
   here the other guineapig cheered, and was suppressed. 
  
   come, that finished the guineapigs thought alice.  now we 
 shall get on better. 
  
   id rather finish my tea, said the hatter, with an anxious 
 look at the queen, who was reading the list of singers. 
  
   you may go, said the king, and the hatter hurriedly left the 
 court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. 
  
   and just take his head off outside, the queen added to one 
 of the officers  but the hatter was out of sight before the 
 officer could get to the door. 
  
   call the next witness said the king. 
  
   the next witness was the duchesss cook.  she carried the 
 pepperbox in her hand, and alice guessed who it was, even before 
 she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began 
 sneezing all at once. 
  
   give your evidence, said the king. 
  
   shant, said the cook. 
  
   the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a 
 low voice, your majesty must crossexamine this witness. 
  
   well, if i must, i must, the king said, with a melancholy 
 air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till 
 his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, what 
 are tarts made of 
  
   pepper, mostly, said the cook. 
  
   treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her. 
  
   collar that dormouse, the queen shrieked out.  behead that 
 dormouse  turn that dormouse out of court  suppress him  pinch 
 him  off with his whiskers 
  
   for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the 
 dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down 
 again, the cook had disappeared. 
  
   never mind said the king, with an air of great relief. 
 call the next witness.  and he added in an undertone to the 
 queen, really, my dear, you must crossexamine the next witness. 
 it quite makes my forehead ache 
  
   alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list, 
 feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, 
 for they havent got much evidence yet, she said to herself. 
 imagine her surprise, when the white rabbit read out, at the top 
 of his shrill little voice, the name alice 
  
  
  
                            chapter xii 
  
                         alices evidence 
  
  
   here cried alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the 
 moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she 
 jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with 
 the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads 
 of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding 
 her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset 
 the week before. 
  
   oh, i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great 
 dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could, 
 for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and 
 she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once 
 and put back into the jurybox, or they would die. 
  
   the trial cannot proceed, said the king in a very grave 
 voice, until all the jurymen are back in their proper places 
 all, he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at alice as 
 he said do. 
  
   alice looked at the jurybox, and saw that, in her haste, she 
 had put the lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing 
 was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable 
 to move.  she soon got it out again, and put it right not that 
 it signifies much, she said to herself i should think it 
 would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other. 
  
   as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of 
 being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and 
 handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write 
 out a history of the accident, all except the lizard, who seemed 
 too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, 
 gazing up into the roof of the court. 
  
   what do you know about this business the king said to 
 alice. 
  
   nothing, said alice. 
  
   nothing whatever persisted the king. 
  
   nothing whatever, said alice. 
  
   thats very important, the king said, turning to the jury. 
 they were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when 
 the white rabbit interrupted  unimportant, your majesty means, 
 of course, he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and 
 making faces at him as he spoke. 
  
   unimportant, of course, i meant, the king hastily said, and 
 went on to himself in an undertone, importantunimportant 
 unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word 
 sounded best. 
  
   some of the jury wrote it down important, and some 
 unimportant.  alice could see this, as she was near enough to 
 look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit, she 
 thought to herself. 
  
   at this moment the king, who had been for some time busily 
 writing in his notebook, cackled out silence and read out 
 from his book, rule fortytwo.  all persons more than a mile 
 high to leave the court. 
  
   everybody looked at alice. 
  
   im not a mile high, said alice. 
  
   you are, said the king. 
  
   nearly two miles high, added the queen. 
  
   well, i shant go, at any rate, said alice  besides, 
 thats not a regular rule  you invented it just now. 
  
   its the oldest rule in the book, said the king. 
  
   then it ought to be number one, said alice. 
  
   the king turned pale, and shut his notebook hastily. 
 consider your verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling 
 voice. 
  
   theres more evidence to come yet, please your majesty, said 
 the white rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry this paper has 
 just been picked up. 
  
   whats in it said the queen. 
  
   i havent opened it yet, said the white rabbit, but it seems 
 to be a letter, written by the prisoner toto somebody. 
  
   it must have been that, said the king, unless it was 
 written to nobody, which isnt usual, you know. 
  
   who is it directed to said one of the jurymen. 
  
   it isnt directed at all, said the white rabbit in fact, 
 theres nothing written on the outside.  he unfolded the paper 
 as he spoke, and added it isnt a letter, after all  its a set 
 of verses. 
  
   are they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of 
 they jurymen. 
  
   no, theyre not, said the white rabbit, and thats the 
 queerest thing about it.  (the jury all looked puzzled.) 
  
   he must have imitated somebody elses hand, said the king. 
 (the jury all brightened up again.) 
  
   please your majesty, said the knave, i didnt write it, and 
 they cant prove i did  theres no name signed at the end. 
  
   if you didnt sign it, said the king, that only makes the 
 matter worse.  you must have meant some mischief, or else youd 
 have signed your name like an honest man. 
  
   there was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the 
 first really clever thing the king had said that day. 
  
   that proves his guilt, said the queen. 
  
   it proves nothing of the sort said alice.  why, you dont 
 even know what theyre about 
  
   read them, said the king. 
  
   the white rabbit put on his spectacles.  where shall i begin, 
 please your majesty he asked. 
  
   begin at the beginning, the king said gravely, and go on 
 till you come to the end  then stop. 
  
   these were the verses the white rabbit read 
  
         they told me you had been to her, 
           and mentioned me to him 
         she gave me a good character, 
           but said i could not swim. 
  
         he sent them word i had not gone 
           (we know it to be true) 
         if she should push the matter on, 
           what would become of you 
  
         i gave her one, they gave him two, 
           you gave us three or more 
         they all returned from him to you, 
           though they were mine before. 
  
         if i or she should chance to be 
           involved in this affair, 
         he trusts to you to set them free, 
           exactly as we were. 
  
         my notion was that you had been 
           (before she had this fit) 
         an obstacle that came between 
           him, and ourselves, and it. 
  
         dont let him know she liked them best, 
           for this must ever be 
         a secret, kept from all the rest, 
           between yourself and me. 
  
   thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet, 
 said the king, rubbing his hands so now let the jury 
  
   if any one of them can explain it, said alice, (she had 
 grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit 
 afraid of interrupting him,) ill give him sixpence.  i dont 
 believe theres an atom of meaning in it. 
  
   the jury all wrote down on their slates, she doesnt believe 
 theres an atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to 
 explain the paper. 
  
   if theres no meaning in it, said the king, that saves a 
 world of trouble, you know, as we neednt try to find any.  and 
 yet i dont know, he went on, spreading out the verses on his 
 knee, and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some 
 meaning in them, after all.  said i could not swim you 
 cant swim, can you he added, turning to the knave. 
  
   the knave shook his head sadly.  do i look like it he said. 
 (which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.) 
  
   all right, so far, said the king, and he went on muttering 
 over the verses to himself  we know it to be true thats 
 the jury, of course i gave her one, they gave him two why, 
 that must be what he did with the tarts, you know 
  
   but, it goes on they all returned from him to you, said 
 alice. 
  
   why, there they are said the king triumphantly, pointing to 
 the tarts on the table.  nothing can be clearer than that. 
 then againbefore she had this fit  you never had fits, my 
 dear, i think he said to the queen. 
  
   never said the queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the 
 lizard as she spoke.  (the unfortunate little bill had left off 
 writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no 
 mark but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was 
 trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) 
  
   then the words dont fit you, said the king, looking round 
 the court with a smile.  there was a dead silence. 
  
   its a pun the king added in an offended tone, and 
 everybody laughed, let the jury consider their verdict, the 
 king said, for about the twentieth time that day. 
  
   no, no said the queen.  sentence firstverdict afterwards. 
  
   stuff and nonsense said alice loudly.  the idea of having 
 the sentence first 
  
   hold your tongue said the queen, turning purple. 
  
   i wont said alice. 
  
   off with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice. 
 nobody moved. 
  
   who cares for you said alice, (she had grown to her full 
 size by this time.)  youre nothing but a pack of cards 
  
   at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying 
 down upon her  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half 
 of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on 
 the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently 
 brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the 
 trees upon her face. 
  
   wake up, alice dear said her sister why, what a long 
 sleep youve had 
  
   oh, ive had such a curious dream said alice, and she told 
 her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange 
 adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and 
 when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, it was a 
 curious dream, dear, certainly  but now run in to your tea its 
 getting late.  so alice got up and ran off, thinking while she 
 ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. 
  
   but her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her 
 head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of 
 little alice and all her wonderful adventures, till she too began 
 dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream 
  
   first, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again the 
 tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes 
 were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her 
 voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back 
 the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesand 
 still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place 
 around her became alive the strange creatures of her little 
 sisters dream. 
  
   the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried 
 bythe frightened mouse splashed his way through the 
 neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as 
 the march hare and his friends shared their neverending meal, 
 and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate 
 guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the 
 duchesss knee, while plates and dishes crashed around itonce 
 more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the lizards 
 slatepencil, and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs, 
 filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable 
 mock turtle. 
  
   so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in 
 wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and 
 all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only 
 rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the 
 reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep 
 bells, and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd 
 boyand the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the gryphon, and 
 all thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the 
 confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the 
 cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles 
 heavy sobs. 
  
   lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of 
 hers would, in the aftertime, be herself a grown woman and how 
 she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and 
 loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about 
 her other little children, and make their eyes bright and eager 
 with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of 
 wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their 
 simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, 
 remembering her own childlife, and the happy summer days.

 orlandoas i remember, adam, it was upon this fashion 
 bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, 
 and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his 
 blessing, to breed me well and there begins my 
 sadness. my brother jaques he keeps at school, and 
 report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part, 
 he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more 
 properly, stays me here at home unkept for call you 
 that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that 
 differs not from the stalling of an ox his horses 
 are bred better for, besides that they are fair 
 with their feeding, they are taught their manage, 
 and to that end riders dearly hired but i, his 
 brother, gain nothing under him but growth for the 
 which his animals on his dunghills are as much 
 bound to him as i. besides this nothing that he so 
 plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave 
 me his countenance seems to take from me he lets 
 me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a 
 brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my 
 gentility with my education. this is it, adam, that 
 grieves me and the spirit of my father, which i 
 think is within me, begins to mutiny against this 
 servitude i will no longer endure it, though yet i 
 know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

 you are my eldest brother and, in the gentle

 courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that 
 you are the firstborn but the same tradition 
 takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers

 orlandoi am no villain i am the youngest son of sir

 a villain that says such a father begot villains.

 orlandoi will not, till i please you shall hear me. my 
 father charged you in his will to give me good 
 education you have trained me like a peasant, 
 obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike 
 qualities. the spirit of my father grows strong in 
 me, and i will no longer endure it therefore allow 
 me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or 
 give me the poor allottery my father left me by

 charlestheres no news at the court, sir, but the old news 
 that is, the old duke is banished by his younger 
 brother the new duke and three or four loving lords 
 have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, 
 whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke 
 therefore he gives them good leave to wander. 
  
 olivercan you tell if rosalind, the dukes daughter, be 
 banished with her father 
  
 charleso, no for the dukes daughter, her cousin, so loves 
 her, being ever from their cradles bred together, 
 that she would have followed her exile, or have died 
 to stay behind her. she is at the court, and no 
 less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and 
 never two ladies loved as they do. 
  
 oliverwhere will the old duke live 
  
 charlesthey say he is already in the forest of arden, and 
 a many merry men with him and there they live like 
 the old robin hood of england they say many young 
 gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time 
 carelessly, as they did in the golden world. 
  
 oliverwhat, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke 
  
 charlesmarry, do i, sir and i came to acquaint you with a 
 matter. i am given, sir, secretly to understand 
 that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition 
 to come in disguised against me to try a fall. 
 tomorrow, sir, i wrestle for my credit and he that 
 escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him 
 well. your brother is but young and tender and, 
 for your love, i would be loath to foil him, as i 
 must, for my own honour, if he come in therefore, 
 out of my love to you, i came hither to acquaint you 
 withal, that either you might stay him from his 
 intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall 
 run into, in that it is a thing of his own search 
 and altogether against my will. 
  
 olivercharles, i thank thee for thy love to me, which 
 thou shalt find i will most kindly requite. i had 
 myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and 
 have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from 
 it, but he is resolute. ill tell thee, charles 
 it is the stubbornest young fellow of france, full 
 of ambition, an envious emulator of every mans 
 good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against 
 me his natural brother therefore use thy 
 discretion i had as lief thou didst break his neck 
 as his finger. and thou wert best look tot for if 
 thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not 
 mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise 
 against thee by poison, entrap thee by some 
 treacherous device and never leave thee till he 
 hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other 
 for, i assure thee, and almost with tears i speak 
 it, there is not one so young and so villanous this 
 day living. i speak but brotherly of him but 
 should i anatomize him to thee as he is, i must 
 blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder. 
  
 charlesi am heartily glad i came hither to you. if he come 
 tomorrow, ill give him his payment if ever he go 
 alone again, ill never wrestle for prize more and 
 so god keep your worship

 in the heart of the world, and especially of my own

 celiai pray thee, rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry. 
  
 rosalinddear celia, i show more mirth than i am mistress of 
 and would you yet i were merrier unless you could 
 teach me to forget a banished father, you must not 
 learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure. 
  
 celiaherein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight 
 that i love thee. if my uncle, thy banished father, 
 had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou 
 hadst been still with me, i could have taught my 
 love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou, 
 if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously 
 tempered as mine is to thee. 
  
 rosalindwell, i will forget the condition of my estate, to 
 rejoice in yours. 
  
 celiayou know my father hath no child but i, nor none is 
 like to have and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt 
 be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy 
 father perforce, i will render thee again in 
 affection by mine honour, i will and when i break 
 that oath, let me turn monster therefore, my 
 sweet rose, my dear rose, be merry. 
  
 rosalindfrom henceforth i will, coz, and devise sports. let 
 me see what think you of falling in love 
  
 celiamarry, i prithee, do, to make sport withal but 
 love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport 
 neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst 
 in honour come off again. 
  
 rosalindwhat shall be our sport, then 
  
 celialet us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from 
 her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally. 
  
 rosalindi would we could do so, for her benefits are 
 mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman 
 doth most mistake in her gifts to women. 
  
 celiatis true for those that she makes fair she scarce 
 makes honest, and those that she makes honest she 
 makes very illfavouredly. 
  
 rosalindnay, now thou goest from fortunes office to 
 natures fortune reigns in gifts of the world, 
 not in the lineaments of nature. 
  
 enter touchstone 
  
 celiano when nature hath made a fair creature, may she 
 not by fortune fall into the fire though nature 
 hath given us wit to flout at fortune, hath not 
 fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument 
  
 rosalindindeed, there is fortune too hard for nature, when 
 fortune makes natures natural the cutteroff of 
 natures wit. 
  
 celiaperadventure this is not fortunes work neither, but 
 natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull 
 to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this 
 natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of 
 the fool is the whetstone of the wits. how now, 
 wit whither wander you 
  
 touchstonemistress, you must come away to your father. 
  
 celiawere you made the messenger 
  
 touchstoneno, by mine honour, but i was bid to come for you. 
  
 rosalindwhere learned you that oath, fool 
  
 touchstoneof a certain knight that swore by his honour they 
 were good pancakes and swore by his honour the 
 mustard was naught now ill stand to it, the 
 pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and 
 yet was not the knight forsworn. 
  
 celiahow prove you that, in the great heap of your 
 knowledge 
  
 rosalinday, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom. 
  
 touchstonestand you both forth now stroke your chins, and 
 swear by your beards that i am a knave. 
  
 celiaby our beards, if we had them, thou art. 
  
 touchstoneby my knavery, if i had it, then i were but if you 
 swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn no 
 more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he 
 never had any or if he had, he had sworn it away 
 before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard. 
  
 celiaprithee, who ist that thou meanest 
  
 touchstoneone that old frederick, your father, loves. 
  
 celiamy fathers love is enough to honour him enough 
 speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation 
 one of these days. 
  
 touchstonethe more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what 
 wise men do foolishly. 
  
 celiaby my troth, thou sayest true for since the little 
 wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery 
 that wise men have makes a great show. here comes 
 monsieur le beau. 
  
 rosalindwith his mouth full of news. 
  
 celiawhich he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young. 
  
 rosalindthen shall we be newscrammed.

 rosalindthou losest thy old smell. 
  
 le beauyou amaze me, ladies i would have told you of good 
 wrestling, which you have lost the sight of. 
  
 rosalindyou tell us the manner of the wrestling. 
  
 le beaui will tell you the beginning and, if it please 
 your ladyships, you may see the end for the best is 
 yet to do and here, where you are, they are coming 
 to perform it. 
  
 celiawell, the beginning, that is dead and buried. 
  
 le beauthere comes an old man and his three sons, 
  
 celiai could match this beginning with an old tale. 
  
 le beauthree proper young men, of excellent growth and presence. 
  
 rosalindwith bills on their necks, be it known unto all men 
 by these presents. 
  
 le beauthe eldest of the three wrestled with charles, the 
 dukes wrestler which charles in a moment threw him 
 and broke three of his ribs, that there is little 
 hope of life in him so he served the second, and 
 so the third. yonder they lie the poor old man, 
 their father, making such pitiful dole over them 
 that all the beholders take his part with weeping. 
  
 rosalindalas 
  
 touchstonebut what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies 
 have lost 
  
 le beauwhy, this that i speak of. 
  
 touchstonethus men may grow wiser every day it is the first 
 time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport 
 for ladies. 
  
 celiaor i, i promise thee. 
  
 rosalindbut is there any else longs to see this broken music 
 in his sides is there yet another dotes upon 
 ribbreaking shall we see this wrestling, cousin 
  
 le beauyou must, if you stay here for here is the place 
 appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to 
 perform it.

 duke frederickhow now, daughter and cousin are you crept hither 
 to see the wrestling 
  
 rosalinday, my liege, so please you give us leave. 
  
 duke frederickyou will take little delight in it, i can tell you 
 there is such odds in the man. in pity of the 
 challengers youth i would fain dissuade him, but he 
 will not be entreated. speak to him, ladies see if 
 you can move him. 
  
 celiacall him hither, good monsieur le beau. 
  
 duke frederickdo so ill not be by. 
  
 le beaumonsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you. 
  
 orlandoi attend them with all respect and duty. 
  
 rosalindyoung man, have you challenged charles the wrestler 
  
 orlandono, fair princess he is the general challenger i 
 come but in, as others do, to try with him the 
 strength of my youth. 
  
 celiayoung gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your 
 years. you have seen cruel proof of this mans 
 strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or 
 knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your 
 adventure would counsel you to a more equal 
 enterprise. we pray you, for your own sake, to 
 embrace your own safety and give over this attempt. 
  
 rosalinddo, young sir your reputation shall not therefore 
 be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke 
 that the wrestling might not go forward. 
  
 orlandoi beseech you, punish me not with your hard 
 thoughts wherein i confess me much guilty, to deny 
 so fair and excellent ladies any thing. but let 
 your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my 
 trial wherein if i be foiled, there is but one 
 shamed that was never gracious if killed, but one 
 dead that was willing to be so i shall do my 
 friends no wrong, for i have none to lament me, the 
 world no injury, for in it i have nothing only in 
 the world i fill up a place, which may be better 
 supplied when i have made it empty. 
  
 rosalindthe little strength that i have, i would it were with you.

 charlesno, i warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him 
 to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him 
 from a first.

 mocked me before but come your ways.

 duke fredericki would thou hadst been son to some man else 
 the world esteemd thy father honourable, 
 but i did find him still mine enemy 
 thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed, 
 hadst thou descended from another house. 
 but fare thee well thou art a gallant youth 
 i would thou hadst told me of another father. 
  
 exeunt duke frederick, train, and le beau 
  
 celiawere i my father, coz, would i do this 
  
 orlandoi am more proud to be sir rowlands son, 
 his youngest son and would not change that calling, 
 to be adopted heir to frederick. 
  
 rosalindmy father loved sir rowland as his soul, 
 and all the world was of my fathers mind 
 had i before known this young man his son, 
 i should have given him tears unto entreaties, 
 ere he should thus have ventured. 
  
 celiagentle cousin, 
 let us go thank him and encourage him 
 my fathers rough and envious disposition 
 sticks me at heart. sir, you have well deserved 
 if you do keep your promises in love 
 but justly, as you have exceeded all promise, 
 your mistress shall be happy. 
  
 rosalindgentleman, 
  
 giving him a chain from her neck 
  
 wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune, 
 that could give more, but that her hand lacks means. 
 shall we go, coz 
  
 celia                  ay. fare you well, fair gentleman. 
  
 orlandocan i not say, i thank you my better parts 
 are all thrown down, and that which here stands up 
 is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block. 
  
 rosalindhe calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes 
 ill ask him what he would. did you call, sir 
 sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown 
 more than your enemies. 
  
 celiawill you go, coz

 orlandowhat passion hangs these weights upon my tongue 
 i cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference. 
 o poor orlando, thou art overthrown 
 or charles or something weaker masters thee. 
  
 reenter le beau 
  
 le beaugood sir, i do in friendship counsel you 
 to leave this place. albeit you have deserved 
 high commendation, true applause and love, 
 yet such is now the dukes condition 
 that he misconstrues all that you have done. 
 the duke is humorous what he is indeed, 
 more suits you to conceive than i to speak of. 
  
 orlandoi thank you, sir and, pray you, tell me this 
 which of the two was daughter of the duke 
 that here was at the wrestling 
  
 le beauneither his daughter, if we judge by manners 
 but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter 
 the other is daughter to the banishd duke, 
 and here detaind by her usurping uncle, 
 to keep his daughter company whose loves 
 are dearer than the natural bond of sisters. 
 but i can tell you that of late this duke 
 hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece, 
 grounded upon no other argument 
 but that the people praise her for her virtues 
 and pity her for her good fathers sake 
 and, on my life, his malice gainst the lady 
 will suddenly break forth. sir, fare you well 
 hereafter, in a better world than this, 
 i shall desire more love and knowledge of you. 
  
 orlandoi rest much bounden to you fare you well.

 should be lamed with reasons and the other mad 
 without any.

 rosalindno, some of it is for my childs father. o, how

 celiao, a good wish upon you you will try in time, in 
 despite of a fall. but, turning these jests out of 
 service, let us talk in good earnest is it 
 possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so 
 strong a liking with old sir rowlands youngest son 
  
 rosalindthe duke my father loved his father dearly. 
  
 celiadoth it therefore ensue that you should love his son 
 dearly by this kind of chase, i should hate him, 
 for my father hated his father dearly yet i hate 
 not orlando. 
  
 rosalindno, faith, hate him not, for my sake. 
  
 celiawhy should i not doth he not deserve well

 if with myself i hold intelligence 
 or have acquaintance with mine own desires, 
 if that i do not dream or be not frantic, 
 as i do trust i am notthen, dear uncle, 
 never so much as in a thought unborn 
 did i offend your highness. 
  
 duke frederickthus do all traitors 
 if their purgation did consist in words, 
 they are as innocent as grace itself 
 let it suffice thee that i trust thee not. 
  
 rosalindyet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor 
 tell me whereon the likelihood depends. 
  
 duke frederickthou art thy fathers daughter theres enough. 
  
 rosalindso was i when your highness took his dukedom 
 so was i when your highness banishd him 
 treason is not inherited, my lord 
 or, if we did derive it from our friends, 
 whats that to me my father was no traitor 
 then, good my liege, mistake me not so much 
 to think my poverty is treacherous. 
  
 celiadear sovereign, hear me speak. 
  
 duke frederickay, celia we stayd her for your sake, 
 else had she with her father ranged along. 
  
 celiai did not then entreat to have her stay 
 it was your pleasure and your own remorse 
 i was too young that time to value her 
 but now i know her if she be a traitor, 
 why so am i we still have slept together, 
 rose at an instant, learnd, playd, eat together, 
 and wheresoever we went, like junos swans, 
 still we went coupled and inseparable. 
  
 duke frederickshe is too subtle for thee and her smoothness, 
 her very silence and her patience 
 speak to the people, and they pity her. 
 thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name 
 and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous 
 when she is gone. then open not thy lips 
 firm and irrevocable is my doom 
 which i have passd upon her she is banishd. 
  
 celiapronounce that sentence then on me, my liege 
 i cannot live out of her company.

 therefore devise with me how we may fly, 
 whither to go and what to bear with us 
 and do not seek to take your change upon you, 
 to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out 
 for, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale, 
 say what thou canst, ill go along with thee.

 beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

 the like do you so shall we pass along

 duke seniornow, my comates and brothers in exile, 
 hath not old custom made this life more sweet 
 than that of painted pomp are not these woods 
 more free from peril than the envious court 
 here feel we but the penalty of adam, 
 the seasons difference, as the icy fang 
 and churlish chiding of the winters wind, 
 which, when it bites and blows upon my body, 
 even till i shrink with cold, i smile and say 
 this is no flattery these are counsellors 
 that feelingly persuade me what i am. 
 sweet are the uses of adversity, 
 which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, 
 wears yet a precious jewel in his head 
 and this our life exempt from public haunt 
 finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, 
 sermons in stones and good in every thing. 
 i would not change it. 
  
 amienshappy is your grace, 
 that can translate the stubbornness of fortune 
 into so quiet and so sweet a style. 
  
 duke seniorcome, shall we go and kill us venison 
 and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools, 
 being native burghers of this desert city, 
 should in their own confines with forked heads 
 have their round haunches gored. 
  
 first lordindeed, my lord, 
 the melancholy jaques grieves at that, 
 and, in that kind, swears you do more usurp 
 than doth your brother that hath banishd you. 
 today my lord of amiens and myself 
 did steal behind him as he lay along 
 under an oak whose antique root peeps out 
 upon the brook that brawls along this wood 
 to the which place a poor sequesterd stag, 
 that from the hunters aim had taen a hurt, 
 did come to languish, and indeed, my lord, 
 the wretched animal heaved forth such groans 
 that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat 
 almost to bursting, and the big round tears 
 coursed one another down his innocent nose 
 in piteous chase and thus the hairy fool 
 much marked of the melancholy jaques, 
 stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook, 
 augmenting it with tears. 
  
 duke seniorbut what said jaques 
 did he not moralize this spectacle 
  
 first lordo, yes, into a thousand similes. 
 first, for his weeping into the needless stream 
 poor deer, quoth he, thou makest a testament 
 as worldlings do, giving thy sum of more 
 to that which had too much then, being there alone, 
 left and abandond of his velvet friends, 
 tis right quoth he thus misery doth part 
 the flux of company anon a careless herd, 
 full of the pasture, jumps along by him 
 and never stays to greet him ay quoth jaques, 
 sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens 
 tis just the fashion wherefore do you look 
 upon that poor and broken bankrupt there 
 thus most invectively he pierceth through 
 the body of the country, city, court, 
 yea, and of this our life, swearing that we 
 are mere usurpers, tyrants and whats worse, 
 to fright the animals and to kill them up 
 in their assignd and native dwellingplace. 
  
 duke seniorand did you leave him in this contemplation 
  
 second lordwe did, my lord, weeping and commenting 
 upon the sobbing deer.

 and unregarded age in corners thrown 
 take that, and he that doth the ravens feed, 
 yea, providently caters for the sparrow, 
 be comfort to my age here is the gold 
 and all this i give you. let me be your servant 
 though i look old, yet i am strong and lusty 
 for in my youth i never did apply 
 hot and rebellious liquors in my blood, 
 nor did not with unbashful forehead woo 
 the means of weakness and debility 
 therefore my age is as a lusty winter, 
 frosty, but kindly let me go with you 
 ill do the service of a younger man 
 in all your business and necessities. 
  
 orlandoo good old man, how well in thee appears 
 the constant service of the antique world, 
 when service sweat for duty, not for meed 
 thou art not for the fashion of these times, 
 where none will sweat but for promotion, 
 and having that, do choke their service up 
 even with the having it is not so with thee. 
 but, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree, 
 that cannot so much as a blossom yield 
 in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry 
 but come thy ways well go along together, 
 and ere we have thy youthful wages spent, 
 well light upon some settled low content. 
  
 adammaster, go on, and i will follow thee, 
 to the last gasp, with truth and loyalty. 
 from seventeen years till now almost fourscore 
 here lived i, but now live here no more. 
 at seventeen years many their fortunes seek 
 but at fourscore it is too late a week 
 yet fortune cannot recompense me better 
 than to die well and not my masters debtor.

 thou hast not loved

 pretty chopt hands had milked and i remember the 
 wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom i took 
 two cods and, giving her them again, said with 
 weeping tears wear these for my sake. we that are 
 true lovers run into strange capers but as all is 
 mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.

 here was he merry, hearing of a song.

 we shall have shortly discord in the spheres. 
 go, seek him tell him i would speak with him. 
  
 enter jaques 
  
 first lordhe saves my labour by his own approach. 
  
 duke seniorwhy, how now, monsieur what a life is this, 
 that your poor friends must woo your company 
 what, you look merrily 
  
 jaquesa fool, a fool i met a fool i the forest, 
 a motley fool a miserable world 
 as i do live by food, i met a fool 
 who laid him down and baskd him in the sun, 
 and raild on lady fortune in good terms, 
 in good set terms and yet a motley fool. 
 good morrow, fool, quoth i. no, sir, quoth he, 
 call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune 
 and then he drew a dial from his poke, 
 and, looking on it with lacklustre eye, 
 says very wisely, it is ten oclock 
 thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags 
 tis but an hour ago since it was nine, 
 and after one hour more twill be eleven 
 and so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe, 
 and then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot 
 and thereby hangs a tale. when i did hear 
 the motley fool thus moral on the time, 
 my lungs began to crow like chanticleer, 
 that fools should be so deepcontemplative, 
 and i did laugh sans intermission 
 an hour by his dial. o noble fool 
 a worthy fool motleys the only wear. 
  
 duke seniorwhat fool is this 
  
 jaqueso worthy fool one that hath been a courtier, 
 and says, if ladies be but young and fair, 
 they have the gift to know it and in his brain, 
 which is as dry as the remainder biscuit 
 after a voyage, he hath strange places crammd 
 with observation, the which he vents 
 in mangled forms. o that i were a fool 
 i am ambitious for a motley coat. 
  
 duke seniorthou shalt have one. 
  
 jaquesit is my only suit 
 provided that you weed your better judgments 
 of all opinion that grows rank in them 
 that i am wise. i must have liberty 
 withal, as large a charter as the wind, 
 to blow on whom i please for so fools have 
 and they that are most galled with my folly, 
 they most must laugh. and why, sir, must they so 
 the why is plain as way to parish church 
 he that a fool doth very wisely hit 
 doth very foolishly, although he smart, 
 not to seem senseless of the bob if not, 
 the wise mans folly is anatomized 
 even by the squandering glances of the fool. 
 invest me in my motley give me leave 
 to speak my mind, and i will through and through 
 cleanse the foul body of the infected world, 
 if they will patiently receive my medicine. 
  
 duke seniorfie on thee i can tell what thou wouldst do. 
  
 jaqueswhat, for a counter, would i do but good 
  
 duke seniormost mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin 
 for thou thyself hast been a libertine, 
 as sensual as the brutish sting itself 
 and all the embossed sores and headed evils, 
 that thou with licence of free foot hast caught, 
 wouldst thou disgorge into the general world. 
  
 jaqueswhy, who cries out on pride, 
 that can therein tax any private party 
 doth it not flow as hugely as the sea, 
 till that the weary very means do ebb 
 what woman in the city do i name, 
 when that i say the citywoman bears 
 the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders 
 who can come in and say that i mean her, 
 when such a one as she such is her neighbour 
 or what is he of basest function 
 that says his bravery is not of my cost, 
 thinking that i mean him, but therein suits 
 his folly to the mettle of my speech 
 there then how then what then let me see wherein 
 my tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right, 
 then he hath wrongd himself if he be free, 
 why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies, 
 unclaimd of any man. but who comes here

 orlandospeak you so gently pardon me, i pray you 
 i thought that all things had been savage here 
 and therefore put i on the countenance 
 of stern commandment. but whateer you are 
 that in this desert inaccessible, 
 under the shade of melancholy boughs, 
 lose and neglect the creeping hours of time 
 if ever you have lookd on better days, 
 if ever been where bells have knolld to church, 
 if ever sat at any good mans feast, 
 if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear 
 and know what tis to pity and be pitied, 
 let gentleness my strong enforcement be 
 in the which hope i blush, and hide my sword. 
  
 duke seniortrue is it that we have seen better days, 
 and have with holy bell been knolld to church 
 and sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes 
 of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd 
 and therefore sit you down in gentleness 
 and take upon command what help we have 
 that to your wanting may be ministerd.

 whiles, like a doe, i go to find my fawn 
 and give it food. there is an old poor man,

 oppressd with two weak evils, age and hunger, 
 i will not touch a bit.

 this wide and universal theatre 
 presents more woeful pageants than the scene 
 wherein we play in. 
  
 jaquesall the worlds a stage, 
 and all the men and women merely players 
 they have their exits and their entrances 
 and one man in his time plays many parts, 
 his acts being seven ages. at first the infant, 
 mewling and puking in the nurses arms. 
 and then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel 
 and shining morning face, creeping like snail 
 unwillingly to school. and then the lover, 
 sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad 
 made to his mistress eyebrow. then a soldier, 
 full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard, 
 jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel, 
 seeking the bubble reputation 
 even in the cannons mouth. and then the justice, 
 in fair round belly with good capon lined, 
 with eyes severe and beard of formal cut, 
 full of wise saws and modern instances 
 and so he plays his part. the sixth age shifts 
 into the lean and slipperd pantaloon, 
 with spectacles on nose and pouch on side, 
 his youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide 
 for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice, 
 turning again toward childish treble, pipes 
 and whistles in his sound. last scene of all, 
 that ends this strange eventful history, 
 is second childishness and mere oblivion, 
 sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

 corinand how like you this shepherds life, master touchstone 
  
 touchstonetruly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good 
 life, but in respect that it is a shepherds life, 
 it is naught. in respect that it is solitary, i 
 like it very well but in respect that it is 
 private, it is a very vile life. now, in respect it 
 is in the fields, it pleaseth me well but in 
 respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. as 
 is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well 
 but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much 
 against my stomach. hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd 
  
 corinno more but that i know the more one sickens the 
 worse at ease he is and that he that wants money, 
 means and content is without three good friends 
 that the property of rain is to wet and fire to 
 burn that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a 
 great cause of the night is lack of the sun that 
 he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may 
 complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred. 
  
 touchstonesuch a one is a natural philosopher. wast ever in 
 court, shepherd 
  
 corinno, truly. 
  
 touchstonethen thou art damned. 
  
 corinnay, i hope. 
  
 touchstonetruly, thou art damned like an illroasted egg, all 
 on one side. 
  
 corinfor not being at court your reason. 
  
 touchstonewhy, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest 
 good manners if thou never sawest good manners, 
 then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is 
 sin, and sin is damnation. thou art in a parlous 
 state, shepherd. 
  
 corinnot a whit, touchstone those that are good manners 
 at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the 
 behavior of the country is most mockable at the 
 court. you told me you salute not at the court, but 
 you kiss your hands that courtesy would be 
 uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds. 
  
 touchstoneinstance, briefly come, instance. 
  
 corinwhy, we are still handling our ewes, and their 
 fells, you know, are greasy. 
  
 touchstonewhy, do not your courtiers hands sweat and is not 
 the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of 
 a man shallow, shallow. a better instance, i say come. 
  
 corinbesides, our hands are hard. 
  
 touchstoneyour lips will feel them the sooner. shallow again. 
 a more sounder instance, come. 
  
 corinand they are often tarred over with the surgery of 
 our sheep and would you have us kiss tar the 
 courtiers hands are perfumed with civet. 
  
 touchstonemost shallow man thou wormsmeat, in respect of a 
 good piece of flesh indeed learn of the wise, and 
 perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar, the 
 very uncleanly flux of a cat. mend the instance, shepherd. 
  
 corinyou have too courtly a wit for me ill rest. 
  
 touchstonewilt thou rest damned god help thee, shallow man 
 god make incision in thee thou art raw. 
  
 corinsir, i am a true labourer i earn that i eat, get 
 that i wear, owe no man hate, envy no mans 
 happiness, glad of other mens good, content with my 
 harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes 
 graze and my lambs suck. 
  
 touchstonethat is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes 
 and the rams together and to offer to get your 
 living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a 
 bellwether, and to betray a shelamb of a 
 twelvemonth to a crookedpated, old, cuckoldly ram, 
 out of all reasonable match. if thou beest not 
 damned for this, the devil himself will have no 
 shepherds i cannot see else how thou shouldst

 teaching all that read to know 
 the quintessence of every sprite 
 heaven would in little show. 
 therefore heaven nature charged 
 that one body should be filld 
 with all graces wideenlarged 
 nature presently distilld 
 helens cheek, but not her heart, 
 cleopatras majesty, 
 atalantas better part, 
 sad lucretias modesty. 
 thus rosalind of many parts 
 by heavenly synod was devised, 
 of many faces, eyes and hearts, 
 to have the touches dearest prized. 
 heaven would that she these gifts should have, 
 and i to live and die her slave. 
  
 rosalindo most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love 
 have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never 
 cried have patience, good people 
  
 celiahow now back, friends shepherd, go off a little. 
 go with him, sirrah. 
  
 touchstonecome, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat 
 though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage. 
  
 exeunt corin and touchstone 
  
 celiadidst thou hear these verses 
  
 rosalindo, yes, i heard them all, and more too for some of 
 them had in them more feet than the verses would bear. 
  
 celiathats no matter the feet might bear the verses. 
  
 rosalinday, but the feet were lame and could not bear 
 themselves without the verse and therefore stood 
 lamely in the verse. 
  
 celiabut didst thou hear without wondering how thy name 
 should be hanged and carved upon these trees 
  
 rosalindi was seven of the nine days out of the wonder 
 before you came for look here what i found on a 
 palmtree. i was never so berhymed since 
 pythagoras time, that i was an irish rat, which i 
 can hardly remember. 
  
 celiatrow you who hath done this 
  
 rosalindis it a man 
  
 celiaand a chain, that you once wore, about his neck. 
 change you colour 
  
 rosalindi prithee, who 
  
 celiao lord, lord it is a hard matter for friends to 
 meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes 
 and so encounter. 
  
 rosalindnay, but who is it 
  
 celiais it possible 
  
 rosalindnay, i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence, 
 tell me who it is. 
  
 celiao wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful 
 wonderful and yet again wonderful, and after that, 
 out of all hooping 
  
 rosalindgood my complexion dost thou think, though i am 
 caparisoned like a man, i have a doublet and hose in 
 my disposition one inch of delay more is a 
 southsea of discovery i prithee, tell me who is it 
 quickly, and speak apace. i would thou couldst 
 stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man 
 out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow 
 mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at 
 all. i prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that 
 may drink thy tidings. 
  
 celiaso you may put a man in your belly. 
  
 rosalindis he of gods making what manner of man is his 
 head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard 
  
 celianay, he hath but a little beard. 
  
 rosalindwhy, god will send more, if the man will be 
 thankful let me stay the growth of his beard, if 
 thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin. 
  
 celiait is young orlando, that tripped up the wrestlers 
 heels and your heart both in an instant. 
  
 rosalindnay, but the devil take mocking speak, sad brow and 
 true maid. 
  
 celiai faith, coz, tis he. 
  
 rosalindorlando 
  
 celiaorlando. 
  
 rosalindalas the day what shall i do with my doublet and 
 hose what did he when thou sawest him what said 
 he how looked he wherein went he what makes 
 him here did he ask for me where remains he 
 how parted he with thee and when shalt thou see 
 him again answer me in one word. 
  
 celiayou must borrow me gargantuas mouth first tis a 
 word too great for any mouth of this ages size. to 
 say ay and no to these particulars is more than to 
 answer in a catechism. 
  
 rosalindbut doth he know that i am in this forest and in 
 mans apparel looks he as freshly as he did the 
 day he wrestled 
  
 celiait is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the 
 propositions of a lover but take a taste of my 
 finding him, and relish it with good observance. 
 i found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn. 
  
 rosalindit may well be called joves tree, when it drops 
 forth such fruit. 
  
 celiagive me audience, good madam. 
  
 rosalindproceed. 
  
 celiathere lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight. 
  
 rosalindthough it be pity to see such a sight, it well 
 becomes the ground. 
  
 celiacry holla to thy tongue, i prithee it curvets 
 unseasonably. he was furnished like a hunter. 
  
 rosalindo, ominous he comes to kill my heart. 
  
 celiai would sing my song without a burden thou bringest 
 me out of tune. 
  
 rosalinddo you not know i am a woman when i think, i must 
 speak. sweet, say on. 
  
 celiayou bring me out. soft comes he not here 
  
 enter orlando and jaques 
  
 rosalindtis he slink by, and note him. 
  
 jaquesi thank you for your company but, good faith, i had 
 as lief have been myself alone. 
  
 orlandoand so had i but yet, for fashion sake, i thank you 
 too for your society. 
  
 jaquesgod be wi you lets meet as little as we can. 
  
 orlandoi do desire we may be better strangers. 
  
 jaquesi pray you, mar no more trees with writing 
 lovesongs in their barks. 
  
 orlandoi pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading 
 them illfavouredly. 
  
 jaquesrosalind is your loves name 
  
 orlandoyes, just. 
  
 jaquesi do not like her name. 
  
 orlandothere was no thought of pleasing you when she was 
 christened. 
  
 jaqueswhat stature is she of 
  
 orlandojust as high as my heart. 
  
 jaquesyou are full of pretty answers. have you not been 
 acquainted with goldsmiths wives, and conned them 
 out of rings 
  
 orlandonot so but i answer you right painted cloth, from 
 whence you have studied your questions. 
  
 jaquesyou have a nimble wit i think twas made of 
 atalantas heels. will you sit down with me and 
 we two will rail against our mistress the world and 
 all our misery. 
  
 orlandoi will chide no breather in the world but myself, 
 against whom i know most faults. 
  
 jaquesthe worst fault you have is to be in love. 
  
 orlandotis a fault i will not change for your best virtue. 
 i am weary of you. 
  
 jaquesby my troth, i was seeking for a fool when i found 
 you. 
  
 orlandohe is drowned in the brook look but in, and you 
 shall see him. 
  
 jaquesthere i shall see mine own figure. 
  
 orlandowhich i take to be either a fool or a cipher. 
  
 jaquesill tarry no longer with you farewell, good 
 signior love. 
  
 orlandoi am glad of your departure adieu, good monsieur 
 melancholy. 
  
 exit jaques 
  
 rosalindaside to celia  i will speak to him, like a saucy 
 lackey and under that habit play the knave with him. 
 do you hear, forester 
  
 orlandovery well what would you 
  
 rosalindi pray you, what ist oclock 
  
 orlandoyou should ask me what time o day theres no clock 
 in the forest. 
  
 rosalindthen there is no true lover in the forest else 
 sighing every minute and groaning every hour would 
 detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock. 
  
 orlandoand why not the swift foot of time had not that 
 been as proper 
  
 rosalindby no means, sir time travels in divers paces with 
 divers persons. ill tell you who time ambles 
 withal, who time trots withal, who time gallops 
 withal and who he stands still withal. 
  
 orlandoi prithee, who doth he trot withal 
  
 rosalindmarry, he trots hard with a young maid between the 
 contract of her marriage and the day it is 
 solemnized if the interim be but a sennight, 
 times pace is so hard that it seems the length of 
 seven year. 
  
 orlandowho ambles time withal 
  
 rosalindwith a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that 
 hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because 
 he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because 
 he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean 
 and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden 
 of heavy tedious penury these time ambles withal. 
  
 orlandowho doth he gallop withal 
  
 rosalindwith a thief to the gallows, for though he go as 
 softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there. 
  
 orlandowho stays it still withal 
  
 rosalindwith lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between 
 term and term and then they perceive not how time moves. 
  
 orlandowhere dwell you, pretty youth 
  
 rosalindwith this shepherdess, my sister here in the 
 skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat. 
  
 orlandoare you native of this place 
  
 rosalindas the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled. 
  
 orlandoyour accent is something finer than you could 
 purchase in so removed a dwelling. 
  
 rosalindi have been told so of many but indeed an old 
 religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was 
 in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship 
 too well, for there he fell in love. i have heard 
 him read many lectures against it, and i thank god 
 i am not a woman, to be touched with so many 
 giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their 
 whole sex withal. 
  
 orlandocan you remember any of the principal evils that he 
 laid to the charge of women 
  
 rosalindthere were none principal they were all like one 
 another as halfpence are, every one fault seeming 
 monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it. 
  
 orlandoi prithee, recount some of them. 
  
 rosalindno, i will not cast away my physic but on those that 
 are sick. there is a man haunts the forest, that 
 abuses our young plants with carving rosalind on 
 their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies 
 on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of 
 rosalind if i could meet that fancymonger i would 
 give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the 
 quotidian of love upon him. 
  
 orlandoi am he that is so loveshaked i pray you tell me 
 your remedy. 
  
 rosalindthere is none of my uncles marks upon you he 
 taught me how to know a man in love in which cage 
 of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner. 
  
 orlandowhat were his marks 
  
 rosalinda lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and 
 sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable 
 spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected, 
 which you have not but i pardon you for that, for 
 simply your having in beard is a younger brothers 
 revenue then your hose should be ungartered, your 
 bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe 
 untied and every thing about you demonstrating a 
 careless desolation but you are no such man you 
 are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as 
 loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other. 
  
 orlandofair youth, i would i could make thee believe i love. 
  
 rosalindme believe it you may as soon make her that you 
 love believe it which, i warrant, she is apter to 
 do than to confess she does that is one of the 
 points in the which women still give the lie to 
 their consciences. but, in good sooth, are you he 
 that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein rosalind 
 is so admired 
  
 orlandoi swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of 
 rosalind, i am that he, that unfortunate he. 
  
 rosalindbut are you so much in love as your rhymes speak 
  
 orlandoneither rhyme nor reason can express how much. 
  
 rosalindlove is merely a madness, and, i tell you, deserves 
 as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and 
 the reason why they are not so punished and cured 
 is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers 
 are in love too. yet i profess curing it by counsel. 
  
 orlandodid you ever cure any so 
  
 rosalindyes, one, and in this manner. he was to imagine me 
 his love, his mistress and i set him every day to 
 woo me at which time would i, being but a moonish 
 youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing 
 and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, 
 inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every 
 passion something and for no passion truly any 
 thing, as boys and women are for the most part 
 cattle of this colour would now like him, now loathe 
 him then entertain him, then forswear him now weep 
 for him, then spit at him that i drave my suitor 
 from his mad humour of love to a living humour of 
 madness which was, to forswear the full stream of 
 the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. 
 and thus i cured him and this way will i take upon 
 me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps 
 heart, that there shall not be one spot of love int. 
  
 orlandoi would not be cured, youth. 
  
 rosalindi would cure you, if you would but call me rosalind 
 and come every day to my cote and woo me. 
  
 orlandonow, by the faith of my love, i will tell me 
 where it is. 
  
 rosalindgo with me to it and ill show it you and by the way 
 you shall tell me where in the forest you live. 
 will you go 
  
 orlandowith all my heart, good youth. 
  
 rosalindnay you must call me rosalind. come, sister, will you go

 doth my simple feature content you 
  
 audreyyour features lord warrant us what features 
  
 touchstonei am here with thee and thy goats, as the most 
 capricious poet, honest ovid, was among the goths. 
  
 jaquesaside  o knowledge illinhabited, worse than jove 
 in a thatched house 
  
 touchstonewhen a mans verses cannot be understood, nor a 
 mans good wit seconded with the forward child 
 understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a 
 great reckoning in a little room. truly, i would 
 the gods had made thee poetical. 
  
 audreyi do not know what poetical is is it honest in 
 deed and word is it a true thing 
  
 touchstoneno, truly for the truest poetry is the most 
 feigning and lovers are given to poetry, and what 
 they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign. 
  
 audreydo you wish then that the gods had made me poetical 
  
 touchstonei do, truly for thou swearest to me thou art 
 honest now, if thou wert a poet, i might have some 
 hope thou didst feign. 
  
 audreywould you not have me honest 
  
 touchstoneno, truly, unless thou wert hardfavoured for 
 honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar. 
  
 jaquesaside  a material fool 
  
 audrey well, i am not fair and therefore i pray the gods 
 make me honest.

 were to put good meat into an unclean dish. 
  
 audreyi am not a slut, though i thank the gods i am foul. 
  
 touchstonewell, praised be the gods for thy foulness 
 sluttishness may come hereafter. but be it as it may 
 be, i will marry thee, and to that end i have been 
 with sir oliver martext, the vicar of the next 
 village, who hath promised to meet me in this place 
 of the forest and to couple us. 
  
 jaquesaside  i would fain see this meeting. 
  
 audreywell, the gods give us joy 
  
 touchstoneamen. a man may, if he were of a fearful heart, 
 stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple 
 but the wood, no assembly but hornbeasts. but what 
 though courage as horns are odious, they are 
 necessary. it is said, many a man knows no end of 
 his goods right many a man has good horns, and 
 knows no end of them. well, that is the dowry of 
 his wife tis none of his own getting. horns 
 even so. poor men alone no, no the noblest deer 
 hath them as huge as the rascal. is the single man 
 therefore blessed no as a walled town is more 
 worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a 
 married man more honourable than the bare brow of a 
 bachelor and by how much defence is better than no 
 skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to 
 want. here comes sir oliver. 
  
 enter sir oliver martext 
  
 sir oliver martext, you are well met will you 
 dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go 
 with you to your chapel 
  
 sir oliver martextis there none here to give the woman

 married under a bush like a beggar get you to 
 church, and have a good priest that can tell you 
 what marriage is this fellow will but join you 
 together as they join wainscot then one of you will 
 prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp. 
  
 touchstoneaside  i am not in the mind but i were better to be 
 married of him than of another for he is not like 
 to marry me well and not being well married, it 
 will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife. 
  
 jaquesgo thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

 celianay, certainly, there is no truth in him. 
  
 rosalinddo you think so 
  
 celiayes i think he is not a pickpurse nor a

 speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks

 that you insult, exult, and all at once, 
 over the wretched what though you have no beauty, 
 as, by my faith, i see no more in you 
 than without candle may go dark to bed 
 must you be therefore proud and pitiless 
 why, what means this why do you look on me 
 i see no more in you than in the ordinary 
 of natures salework. ods my little life, 
 i think she means to tangle my eyes too 
 no, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it 
 tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair, 
 your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream, 
 that can entame my spirits to your worship. 
 you foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her, 
 like foggy south puffing with wind and rain 
 you are a thousand times a properer man 
 than she a woman tis such fools as you 
 that makes the world full of illfavourd children 
 tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her 
 and out of you she sees herself more proper 
 than any of her lineaments can show her. 
 but, mistress, know yourself down on your knees, 
 and thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love 
 for i must tell you friendly in your ear, 
 sell when you can you are not for all markets

 foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.

 but what care i for words yet words do well 
 when he that speaks them pleases those that hear. 
 it is a pretty youth not very pretty 
 but, sure, hes proud, and yet his pride becomes him 
 hell make a proper man the best thing in him 
 is his complexion and faster than his tongue 
 did make offence his eye did heal it up. 
 he is not very tall yet for his years hes tall 
 his leg is but so so and yet tis well 
 there was a pretty redness in his lip, 
 a little riper and more lusty red 
 than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference 
 between the constant red and mingled damask. 
 there be some women, silvius, had they markd him 
 in parcels as i did, would have gone near 
 to fall in love with him but, for my part, 
 i love him not nor hate him not and yet 
 i have more cause to hate him than to love him 
 for what had he to do to chide at me 
 he said mine eyes were black and my hair black 
 and, now i am rememberd, scornd at me 
 i marvel why i answerd not again 
 but thats all one omittance is no quittance. 
 ill write to him a very taunting letter, 
 and thou shalt bear it wilt thou, silvius 
  
 silviusphebe, with all my heart. 
  
 phebeill write it straight 
 the matters in my head and in my heart 
 i will be bitter with him and passing short.

 jaquesi prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted 
 with thee. 
  
 rosalindthey say you are a melancholy fellow. 
  
 jaquesi am so i do love it better than laughing. 
  
 rosalindthose that are in extremity of either are abominable 
 fellows and betray themselves to every modern 
 censure worse than drunkards. 
  
 jaqueswhy, tis good to be sad and say nothing. 
  
 rosalindwhy then, tis good to be a post. 
  
 jaquesi have neither the scholars melancholy, which is 
 emulation, nor the musicians, which is fantastical, 
 nor the courtiers, which is proud, nor the 
 soldiers, which is ambitious, nor the lawyers, 
 which is politic, nor the ladys, which is nice, nor 
 the lovers, which is all these but it is a 
 melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples, 
 extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundrys 
 contemplation of my travels, in which my often 
 rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness. 
  
 rosalinda traveller by my faith, you have great reason to 
 be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see 
 other mens then, to have seen much and to have 
 nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands. 
  
 jaquesyes, i have gained my experience. 
  
 rosalindand your experience makes you sad i had rather have 
 a fool to make me merry than experience to make me 
 sad and to travel for it too 
  
 enter orlando

 jaquesnay, then, god be wi you, an you talk in blank verse. 
  
 exit 
  
 rosalindfarewell, monsieur traveller look you lisp and 
 wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your 
 own country, be out of love with your nativity and 
 almost chide god for making you that countenance you 
 are, or i will scarce think you have swam in a 
 gondola. why, how now, orlando where have you been 
 all this while you a lover an you serve me such 
 another trick, never come in my sight more. 
  
 orlandomy fair rosalind, i come within an hour of my promise. 
  
 rosalindbreak an hours promise in love he that will 
 divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but 
 a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the 
 affairs of love, it may be said of him that cupid 
 hath clapped him o the shoulder, but ill warrant 
 him heartwhole. 
  
 orlandopardon me, dear rosalind. 
  
 rosalindnay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight i 
 had as lief be wooed of a snail. 
  
 orlandoof a snail 
  
 rosalinday, of a snail for though he comes slowly, he 
 carries his house on his head a better jointure, 
 i think, than you make a woman besides he brings 
 his destiny with him. 
  
 orlandowhats that 
  
 rosalindwhy, horns, which such as you are fain to be 
 beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in 
 his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife. 
  
 orlandovirtue is no hornmaker and my rosalind is virtuous. 
  
 rosalindand i am your rosalind. 
  
 celiait pleases him to call you so but he hath a 
 rosalind of a better leer than you. 
  
 rosalindcome, woo me, woo me, for now i am in a holiday 
 humour and like enough to consent. what would you 
 say to me now, an i were your very very rosalind 
  
 orlandoi would kiss before i spoke. 
  
 rosalindnay, you were better speak first, and when you were 
 gravelled for lack of matter, you might take 
 occasion to kiss. very good orators, when they are 
 out, they will spit and for lovers lackinggod 
 warn usmatter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss. 
  
 orlandohow if the kiss be denied 
  
 rosalindthen she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter. 
  
 orlandowho could be out, being before his beloved mistress 
  
 rosalindmarry, that should you, if i were your mistress, or 
 i should think my honesty ranker than my wit. 
  
 orlandowhat, of my suit 
  
 rosalindnot out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. 
 am not i your rosalind 
  
 orlandoi take some joy to say you are, because i would be 
 talking of her. 
  
 rosalindwell in her person i say i will not have you. 
  
 orlandothen in mine own person i die. 
  
 rosalindno, faith, die by attorney. the poor world is 
 almost six thousand years old, and in all this time 
 there was not any man died in his own person, 
 videlicit, in a lovecause. troilus had his brains 
 dashed out with a grecian club yet he did what he 
 could to die before, and he is one of the patterns 
 of love. leander, he would have lived many a fair 
 year, though hero had turned nun, if it had not been 
 for a hot midsummer night for, good youth, he went 
 but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being 
 taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish 
 coroners of that age found it was hero of sestos. 
 but these are all lies men have died from time to 
 time and worms have eaten them, but not for love. 
  
 orlandoi would not have my right rosalind of this mind, 
 for, i protest, her frown might kill me. 
  
 rosalindby this hand, it will not kill a fly. but come, now 
 i will be your rosalind in a more comingon 
 disposition, and ask me what you will. i will grant 
 it. 
  
 orlandothen love me, rosalind. 
  
 rosalindyes, faith, will i, fridays and saturdays and all. 
  
 orlandoand wilt thou have me 
  
 rosalinday, and twenty such. 
  
 orlandowhat sayest thou 
  
 rosalindare you not good 
  
 orlandoi hope so. 
  
 rosalindwhy then, can one desire too much of a good thing 
 come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us. 
 give me your hand, orlando. what do you say, sister 
  
 orlandopray thee, marry us. 
  
 celiai cannot say the words. 
  
 rosalindyou must begin, will you, orlando 
  
 celiago to. will you, orlando, have to wife this rosalind 
  
 orlandoi will. 
  
 rosalinday, but when 
  
 orlandowhy now as fast as she can marry us. 
  
 rosalindthen you must say i take thee, rosalind, for wife. 
  
 orlandoi take thee, rosalind, for wife. 
  
 rosalindi might ask you for your commission but i do take 
 thee, orlando, for my husband theres a girl goes 
 before the priest and certainly a womans thought 
 runs before her actions. 
  
 orlandoso do all thoughts they are winged. 
  
 rosalindnow tell me how long you would have her after you 
 have possessed her. 
  
 orlandofor ever and a day. 
  
 rosalindsay a day, without the ever. no, no, orlando 
 men are april when they woo, december when they wed 
 maids are may when they are maids, but the sky 
 changes when they are wives. i will be more jealous 
 of thee than a barbary cockpigeon over his hen, 
 more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more 
 newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires 
 than a monkey i will weep for nothing, like diana 
 in the fountain, and i will do that when you are 
 disposed to be merry i will laugh like a hyen, and 
 that when thou art inclined to sleep. 
  
 orlandobut will my rosalind do so 
  
 rosalindby my life, she will do as i do. 
  
 orlandoo, but she is wise. 
  
 rosalindor else she could not have the wit to do this the 
 wiser, the waywarder make the doors upon a womans 
 wit and it will out at the casement shut that and 
 twill out at the keyhole stop that, twill fly 
 with the smoke out at the chimney. 
  
 orlandoa man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say 
 wit, whither wilt 
  
 rosalindnay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met 
 your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed. 
  
 orlandoand what wit could wit have to excuse that 
  
 rosalindmarry, to say she came to seek you there. you shall 
 never take her without her answer, unless you take 
 her without her tongue. o, that woman that cannot 
 make her fault her husbands occasion, let her 
 never nurse her child herself, for she will breed 
 it like a fool 
  
 orlandofor these two hours, rosalind, i will leave thee. 
  
 rosalindalas dear love, i cannot lack thee two hours. 
  
 orlandoi must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock i 
 will be with thee again. 
  
 rosalinday, go your ways, go your ways i knew what you 
 would prove my friends told me as much, and i 
 thought no less that flattering tongue of yours 
 won me tis but one cast away, and so, come, 
 death two oclock is your hour 
  
 orlandoay, sweet rosalind. 
  
 rosalindby my troth, and in good earnest, and so god mend 
 me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, 
 if you break one jot of your promise or come one 
 minute behind your hour, i will think you the most 
 pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover 
 and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that 
 may be chosen out of the gross band of the 
 unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep 
 your promise. 
  
 orlandowith no less religion than if thou wert indeed my 
 rosalind so adieu. 
  
 rosalindwell, time is the old justice that examines all such 
 offenders, and let time try adieu.

 silviusmy errand is to you, fair youth 
 my gentle phebe bid me give you this

 which she did use as she was writing of it, 
 it bears an angry tenor pardon me 
 i am but as a guiltless messenger. 
  
 rosalindpatience herself would startle at this letter 
 and play the swaggerer bear this, bear all 
 she says i am not fair, that i lack manners 
 she calls me proud, and that she could not love me, 
 were man as rare as phoenix. ods my will 
 her love is not the hare that i do hunt 
 why writes she so to me well, shepherd, well, 
 this is a letter of your own device. 
  
 silviusno, i protest, i know not the contents 
 phebe did write it. 
  
 rosalindcome, come, you are a fool 
 and turnd into the extremity of love. 
 i saw her hand she has a leathern hand. 
 a freestonecolourd hand i verily did think 
 that her old gloves were on, but twas her hands 
 she has a huswifes hand but thats no matter 
 i say she never did invent this letter 
 this is a mans invention and his hand. 
  
 silviussure, it is hers. 
  
 rosalindwhy, tis a boisterous and a cruel style. 
 a style forchallengers why, she defies me, 
 like turk to christian womens gentle brain 
 could not drop forth such giantrude invention 
 such ethiope words, blacker in their effect 
 than in their countenance. will you hear the letter

 warrst thou with a womans heart 
 did you ever hear such railing 
 whiles the eye of man did woo me, 
 that could do no vengeance to me. 
 meaning me a beast. 
 if the scorn of your bright eyne 
 have power to raise such love in mine, 
 alack, in me what strange effect 
 would they work in mild aspect 
 whiles you chid me, i did love 
 how then might your prayers move 
 he that brings this love to thee 
 little knows this love in me 
 and by him seal up thy mind 
 whether that thy youth and kind 
 will the faithful offer take 
 of me and all that i can make 
 or else by him my love deny, 
 and then ill study how to die. 
  
 silviuscall you this chiding 
  
 celiaalas, poor shepherd 
  
 rosalinddo you pity him no, he deserves no pity. wilt 
 thou love such a woman what, to make thee an 
 instrument and play false strains upon thee not to 
 be endured well, go your way to her, for i see 
 love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to 
 her that if she love me, i charge her to love 
 thee if she will not, i will never have her unless 
 thou entreat for her. if you be a true lover,

 oliverwhen last the young orlando parted from you 
 he left a promise to return again 
 within an hour, and pacing through the forest, 
 chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, 
 lo, what befell he threw his eye aside, 
 and mark what object did present itself 
 under an oak, whose boughs were mossd with age 
 and high top bald with dry antiquity, 
 a wretched ragged man, oergrown with hair, 
 lay sleeping on his back about his neck 
 a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, 
 who with her head nimble in threats approachd 
 the opening of his mouth but suddenly, 
 seeing orlando, it unlinkd itself, 
 and with indented glides did slip away 
 into a bush under which bushs shade 
 a lioness, with udders all drawn dry, 
 lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch, 
 when that the sleeping man should stir for tis 
 the royal disposition of that beast 
 to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead 
 this seen, orlando did approach the man 
 and found it was his brother, his elder brother. 
  
 celiao, i have heard him speak of that same brother 
 and he did render him the most unnatural 
 that lived amongst men. 
  
 oliverand well he might so do, 
 for well i know he was unnatural.

 food to the suckd and hungry lioness 
  
 olivertwice did he turn his back and purposed so 
 but kindness, nobler ever than revenge, 
 and nature, stronger than his just occasion, 
 made him give battle to the lioness, 
 who quickly fell before him in which hurtling 
 from miserable slumber i awaked.

 when from the first to last betwixt us two 
 tears our recountments had most kindly bathed, 
 as how i came into that desert place 
 in brief, he led me to the gentle duke, 
 who gave me fresh array and entertainment, 
 committing me unto my brothers love 
 who led me instantly unto his cave, 
 there strippd himself, and here upon his arm 
 the lioness had torn some flesh away, 
 which all this while had bled and now he fainted 
 and cried, in fainting, upon rosalind. 
 brief, i recoverd him, bound up his wound 
 and, after some small space, being strong at heart, 
 he sent me hither, stranger as i am, 
 to tell this story, that you might excuse 
 his broken promise, and to give this napkin 
 dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth 
 that he in sport doth call his rosalind.

 the height of heartheaviness, by how much i shall 
 think my brother happy in having what he wishes for. 
  
 rosalindwhy then, tomorrow i cannot serve your turn for rosalind 
  
 orlandoi can live no longer by thinking. 
  
 rosalindi will weary you then no longer with idle talking. 
 know of me then, for now i speak to some purpose, 
 that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i 
 speak not this that you should bear a good opinion 
 of my knowledge, insomuch i say i know you are 
 neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in 
 some little measure draw a belief from you, to do 
 yourself good and not to grace me. believe then, if 
 you please, that i can do strange things i have, 
 since i was three year old, conversed with a 
 magician, most profound in his art and yet not 
 damnable. if you do love rosalind so near the heart 
 as your gesture cries it out, when your brother 
 marries aliena, shall you marry her i know into 
 what straits of fortune she is driven and it is 
 not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient 
 to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human 
 as she is and without any danger. 
  
 orlandospeakest thou in sober meanings 
  
 rosalindby my life, i do which i tender dearly, though i 
 say i am a magician. therefore, put you in your 
 best array bid your friends for if you will be 
 married tomorrow, you shall, and to rosalind, if you will.

 second pageifaith, ifaith and both in a tune, like two

 song. 
 it was a lover and his lass, 
 with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
 that oer the green cornfield did pass 
 in the spring time, the only pretty ring time, 
 when birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding 
 sweet lovers love the spring. 
  
 between the acres of the rye, 
 with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino 
 these pretty country folks would lie, 
 in spring time, c. 
  
 this carol they began that hour, 
 with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, 
 how that a life was but a flower 
 in spring time, c. 
  
 and therefore take the present time, 
 with a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino 
 for love is crowned with the prime 
 in spring time, c.

 matter in the ditty, yet the note was very 
 untuneable. 
  
 first pageyou are deceived, sir we kept time, we lost not our time.

 duke seniordost thou believe, orlando, that the boy 
 can do all this that he hath promised 
  
 orlandoi sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not 
 as those that fear they hope, and know they fear. 
  
 enter rosalind, silvius, and phebe 
  
 rosalindpatience once more, whiles our compact is urged 
 you say, if i bring in your rosalind, 
 you will bestow her on orlando here

 youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd 
  
 phebeso is the bargain. 
  
 rosalindyou say, that youll have phebe, if she will 
  
 silviusthough to have her and death were both one thing. 
  
 rosalindi have promised to make all this matter even. 
 keep you your word, o duke, to give your daughter 
 you yours, orlando, to receive his daughter 
 keep your word, phebe, that youll marry me, 
 or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd 
 keep your word, silvius, that youll marry her. 
 if she refuse me and from hence i go, 
 to make these doubts all even. 
  
 exeunt rosalind and celia 
  
 duke seniori do remember in this shepherd boy 
 some lively touches of my daughters favour. 
  
 orlandomy lord, the first time that i ever saw him 
 methought he was a brother to your daughter 
 but, my good lord, this boy is forestborn, 
 and hath been tutord in the rudiments 
 of many desperate studies by his uncle, 
 whom he reports to be a great magician, 
 obscured in the circle of this forest. 
  
 enter touchstone and audrey 
  
 jaquesthere is, sure, another flood toward, and these 
 couples are coming to the ark. here comes a pair of 
 very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools. 
  
 touchstonesalutation and greeting to you all 
  
 jaquesgood my lord, bid him welcome this is the 
 motleyminded gentleman that i have so often met in 
 the forest he hath been a courtier, he swears. 
  
 touchstoneif any man doubt that, let him put me to my 
 purgation. i have trod a measure i have flattered 
 a lady i have been politic with my friend, smooth 
 with mine enemy i have undone three tailors i have 
 had four quarrels, and like to have fought one. 
  
 jaquesand how was that taen up 
  
 touchstonefaith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the 
 seventh cause. 
  
 jaqueshow seventh cause good my lord, like this fellow. 
  
 duke seniori like him very well. 
  
 touchstonegod ild you, sir i desire you of the like. i 
 press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country 
 copulatives, to swear and to forswear according as 
 marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin, 
 sir, an illfavoured thing, sir, but mine own a poor 
 humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else 
 will rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a 
 poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster. 
  
 duke seniorby my faith, he is very swift and sententious. 
  
 touchstoneaccording to the fools bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases. 
  
 jaquesbut, for the seventh cause how did you find the 
 quarrel on the seventh cause 
  
 touchstoneupon a lie seven times removedbear your body more 
 seeming, audreyas thus, sir. i did dislike the 
 cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word, 
 if i said his beard was not cut well, he was in the 
 mind it was this is called the retort courteous. 
 if i sent him word again it was not well cut, he 
 would send me word, he cut it to please himself 
 this is called the quip modest. if again it was 
 not well cut, he disabled my judgment this is 
 called the reply churlish. if again it was not 
 well cut, he would answer, i spake not true this 
 is called the reproof valiant. if again it was not 
 well cut, he would say i lied this is called the 
 countercheque quarrelsome and so to the lie 
 circumstantial and the lie direct. 
  
 jaquesand how oft did you say his beard was not well cut 
  
 touchstonei durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, 
 nor he durst not give me the lie direct and so we 
 measured swords and parted. 
  
 jaquescan you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie 
  
 touchstoneo sir, we quarrel in print, by the book as you have 
 books for good manners i will name you the degrees. 
 the first, the retort courteous the second, the 
 quip modest the third, the reply churlish the 
 fourth, the reproof valiant the fifth, the 
 countercheque quarrelsome the sixth, the lie with 
 circumstance the seventh, the lie direct. all 
 these you may avoid but the lie direct and you may 
 avoid that too, with an if. i knew when seven 
 justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the 
 parties were met themselves, one of them thought but 
 of an if, as, if you said so, then i said so and 
 they shook hands and swore brothers. your if is the 
 only peacemaker much virtue in if. 
  
 jaquesis not this a rare fellow, my lord hes as good at 
 any thing and yet a fool. 
  
 duke seniorhe uses his folly like a stalkinghorse and under 
 the presentation of that he shoots his wit. 
  
 enter hymen, rosalind, and celia

 you and you are heart in heart 
 you to his love must accord, 
 or have a woman to your lord 
 you and you are sure together,

 how thus we met, and these things finish.

 duke senioro my dear niece, welcome thou art to me 
 even daughter, welcome, in no less degree. 
  
 phebei will not eat my word, now thou art mine 
 thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine. 
  
 enter jaques de boys 
  
 jaques de boyslet me have audience for a word or two 
 i am the second son of old sir rowland, 
 that bring these tidings to this fair assembly. 
 duke frederick, hearing how that every day 
 men of great worth resorted to this forest, 
 addressd a mighty power which were on foot, 
 in his own conduct, purposely to take 
 his brother here and put him to the sword 
 and to the skirts of this wild wood he came 
 where meeting with an old religious man, 
 after some question with him, was converted 
 both from his enterprise and from the world, 
 his crown bequeathing to his banishd brother, 
 and all their lands restored to them again 
 that were with him exiled. this to be true, 
 i do engage my life. 
  
 duke seniorwelcome, young man 
 thou offerst fairly to thy brothers wedding 
 to one his lands withheld, and to the other 
 a land itself at large, a potent dukedom. 
 first, in this forest, let us do those ends 
 that here were well begun and well begot 
 and after, every of this happy number 
 that have endured shrewd days and nights with us 
 shall share the good of our returned fortune, 
 according to the measure of their states. 
 meantime, forget this newfalln dignity 
 and fall into our rustic revelry. 
 play, music and you, brides and bridegrooms all, 
 with measure heapd in joy, to the measures fall. 
  
 jaquessir, by your patience. if i heard you rightly, 
 the duke hath put on a religious life 
 and thrown into neglect the pompous court 
  
 jaques de boyshe hath. 
  
 jaquesto him will i  out of these convertites 
 there is much matter to be heard and learnd. 
  
 to duke senior 
  
 you to your former honour i bequeath 
 your patience and your virtue well deserves it 
  
 to orlando 
  
 you to a love that your true faith doth merit 
  
 to oliver 
  
 you to your land and love and great allies 
  
 to silvius 
  
 you to a long and welldeserved bed 
  
 to touchstone 
  
 and you to wrangling for thy loving voyage 
 is but for two months victualld. so, to your pleasures 
 i am for other than for dancing measures. 
  
 duke seniorstay, jaques, stay. 
  
 jaquesto see no pastime iwhat you would have 
 ill stay to know at your abandond cave. 
  
 exit 
  
 duke seniorproceed, proceed we will begin these rites, 
 as we do trust theyll end, in true delights. 
  
 a dance 
  
  
  
  
 as you like it 
  
 epilogue 
  
  
 rosalindit is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue 
 but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord 
 the prologue. if it be true that good wine needs 
 no bush, tis true that a good play needs no 
 epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes, 
 and good plays prove the better by the help of good 
 epilogues. what a case am i in then, that am 
 neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with 
 you in the behalf of a good play i am not 
 furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not 
 become me my way is to conjure you and ill begin 
 with the women. i charge you, o women, for the love 
 you bear to men, to like as much of this play as 
 please you and i charge you, o men, for the love 
 you bear to womenas i perceive by your simpering, 
 none of you hates themthat between you and the 
 women the play may please. if i were a woman i 
 would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased 
 me, complexions that liked me and breaths that i 
 defied not and, i am sure, as many as have good 
 beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my 
 kind offer, when i make curtsy, bid me farewell.
